# Comprehensive Report on Chronic Condition Prediction Data

## Executive Summary
This report provides an in-depth analysis of the Chronic Condition Prediction dataset, which simulates the likelihood of individuals developing chronic conditions based on various health and demographic attributes. The dataset includes both numerical and categorical features, with a total of 1000 samples. Key findings indicate that significant drift has been detected in several features, including BMI, Blood Pressure, Cholesterol, Income, Physical Activity, and Education Level. This drift suggests changes in the underlying data distribution, which may impact predictive modeling efforts.

## Dataset Synopsis
### Dataset Title
**Chronic Condition Prediction Data**

### Description
The dataset simulates the likelihood of individuals developing a chronic condition based on attributes such as Age, BMI, Blood Pressure, Cholesterol, Physical Activity, Smoking Status, Diet Quality, Family History, Income, and Education Level. The 'ChronicCondition' variable serves as the label, indicating whether an individual is likely (1) or not likely (0) to develop the chronic condition.

### Features
- **Numerical Features**: Age, BMI, Blood Pressure, Cholesterol, Physical Activity, Income
- **Categorical Features**: Smoking Status, Diet Quality, Family History, Education Level
- **Label**: ChronicCondition

### Column Types and Ranges
- **Age**: int (18 to 90 years)
- **BMI**: float (18.5 to 40.0)
- **Blood Pressure**: int (80 to 180 mmHg)
- **Cholesterol**: int (150 to 300 mg/dL)
- **Physical Activity**: int (0 to 7 days per week)
- **Smoking Status**: int (0: Non-smoker, 1: Former smoker, 2: Current smoker)
- **Diet Quality**: int (0: Poor, 1: Average, 2: Good)
- **Family History**: int (0: No family history, 1: Family history)
- **Income**: float ($20,000 to $100,000)
- **Education Level**: int (0: No formal education, 1: High school diploma, 2: Bachelor degree, 3: Graduate degree)
- **ChronicCondition**: int (0: No chronic condition, 1: Chronic condition)

## Detailed Tools Analysis
### Drift Analysis
The Kullback-Leibler divergence was used to assess the drift in the dataset. The following features exhibited drift:

- **BMI**
  - Drift Score: 0.1126
  - Drift Detected: Yes

- **Blood Pressure**
  - Drift Score: 0.3296
  - Drift Detected: Yes

- **Cholesterol**
  - Drift Score: 0.2345
  - Drift Detected: Yes

- **Income**
  - Drift Score: 0.9163
  - Drift Detected: Yes

- **Physical Activity**
  - Drift Score: 7.4844
  - Drift Detected: Yes

- **Education Level**
  - Drift Score: 1.6717
  - Drift Detected: Yes

The features Age, Diet Quality, Family History, and Smoking Status did not show significant drift, indicating stability in their distributions.

### SHAP Values Analysis
SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values were calculated to understand the impact of each feature on the prediction of chronic conditions. The following insights were observed:

- **Income**: Increased from 0.0659 (reference) to 0.1255 (current), indicating a higher influence on the prediction.
- **BMI**: Increased from 0.1412 (reference) to 0.1678 (current), showing a significant contribution to the model.
- **Physical Activity**: Decreased from 0.0982 (reference) to 0.0773 (current), indicating a reduced impact on the prediction.

## Conclusion
The Chronic Condition Prediction dataset provides valuable insights into the factors influencing the likelihood of developing chronic conditions. The detection of drift in several key features suggests that the underlying data distributions have changed, which may affect predictive modeling efforts. Continuous monitoring and updating of the model are recommended to ensure accuracy and relevance. The SHAP values analysis further highlights the importance of specific features, particularly Income and BMI, in predicting chronic conditions. Future work should focus on addressing the drift and refining the predictive models based on the latest data trends.
