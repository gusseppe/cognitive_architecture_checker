        ## Overview
        Overview report

        ## Details

        ### Label Insight
        The label in the "Chronic Condition Prediction Data" dataset is named **ChronicCondition**. This label serves as a binary indicator of an individual's likelihood of developing a chronic condition based on various health and demographic attributes. 

### Explanation of the Label:
- **Name**: ChronicCondition
- **Description**: The label indicates whether an individual is likely to develop a chronic condition (1) or not (0). Specifically, a value of '0' signifies that the individual is not likely to develop a chronic condition, while a value of '1' indicates a likelihood of developing such a condition.
- **Type**: Categorical
- **Possible Values**: 
  - '0': No chronic condition
  - '1': Chronic condition
- **Data Type**: Integer (int)

### Context:
The label is derived from a combination of various attributes, including Age, BMI, Blood Pressure, Cholesterol levels, Physical Activity, Smoking Status, Diet Quality, Family History, Income, and Education Level. These factors are commonly associated with the risk of developing chronic conditions, making the label a crucial outcome variable for predictive modeling in healthcare.

### Potential Issues:
While the label is straightforward, there are a few considerations:
1. **Binary Nature**: The binary classification may oversimplify the complexity of chronic conditions, which can vary in severity and type. This could lead to a loss of nuanced information.
2. **Imbalance**: If the dataset is imbalanced (i.e., significantly more instances of one class than the other), it may affect the performance of predictive models, leading to biased predictions.
3. **Definition of Chronic Condition**: The dataset does not specify which chronic conditions are being predicted, which could lead to ambiguity in interpretation and application of the model.

Overall, the ChronicCondition label is a critical component of the dataset, providing a clear target for predictive analysis, but it is essential to consider the context and potential limitations when utilizing this data for modeling purposes.

- **Dataset Drift Detected**: No

#### Insights and Interpretations
The analysis revealed that there is no significant drift detected in the 'Age' feature, as indicated by a drift score of 0.0378, which is below the threshold of 0.1. The distributions of 'Age' in both the reference and current datasets are consistent, suggesting that the model's performance is unlikely to be adversely affected by changes in this feature.

- **Current Distribution**: 
  - The distribution of ages in the current dataset shows a slight skew towards middle-aged individuals, with notable frequencies at ages 42.0, 53.0, and 58.5.

- **Reference Distribution**: 
  - The reference dataset displays a more uniform distribution across the age range, with peaks at ages 54.0 and 46.8.

The absence of drift indicates that the model can reliably use the 'Age' feature for predictions without concerns of performance degradation due to changes in data distribution.

### 2.2 SHAP Values Analysis (get_shap_values)

#### Detailed Analysis of Results
The SHAP values were calculated to understand the impact of the 'Age' feature on the model's predictions. The mean absolute SHAP values were compared between the reference and current datasets.

- **Reference Mean(|SHAP value|)**: 0.0891 (Rank Position: 3)
- **Current Mean(|SHAP value|)**: 0.0509 (Rank Position: 5)

#### Insights and Interpretations
The SHAP analysis indicates a decrease in the average impact of the 'Age' feature on the model's predictions from the reference dataset to the current dataset. The mean absolute SHAP value dropped from 0.0891 to 0.0509, suggesting that 'Age' has become less influential in the current dataset compared to the reference.

- The rank position of 'Age' also shifted from 3rd to 5th, indicating a relative decrease in its importance among the features used for prediction. This could imply that other features may have gained more significance in the current dataset, potentially due to changes in the underlying data distribution or the relationships between features.

## 3. Overall Feature Analysis

### Summary of Key Findings
The analysis of the 'Age' feature within the Chronic Condition Prediction dataset yielded the following key findings:

1. **No Data Drift Detected**: The Kullback-Leibler divergence analysis confirmed that the distribution of 'Age' has remained stable between the reference and current datasets, indicating that the model can continue to rely on this feature without concerns of performance degradation.

2. **Decreased Feature Impact**: The SHAP values analysis revealed a significant reduction in the average impact of 'Age' on the model's predictions, suggesting that while the feature remains stable, its relative importance has diminished in the context of the current dataset.

3. **Implications for Model Performance**: The findings suggest that while 'Age' is a stable feature, stakeholders should consider the changing importance of features in the model. Continuous monitoring of feature impacts and distributions is recommended to ensure optimal model performance.

In conclusion, while the 'Age' feature remains a reliable predictor without drift, its decreasing influence highlights the need for ongoing evaluation of feature contributions in predictive modeling.

## 2. Tool Results

### 2.1. Data Drift Report (get_drift_report)

#### Detailed Analysis of Results
The data drift report was generated to assess whether the distribution of the Physical Activity feature has changed significantly between the reference dataset (used for training) and the current dataset (used for inference). The Kullback-Leibler divergence was employed as the statistical test to measure the drift.

- **Drift Share**: 0.25
- **Number of Columns Analyzed**: 10
- **Number of Drifted Columns**: 1
- **Share of Drifted Columns**: 0.1
- **Dataset Drift Detected**: True

For the Physical Activity feature:
- **Statistical Test Used**: Kullback-Leibler divergence
- **Statistical Test Threshold**: 0.1
- **Drift Score**: 7.4844 (indicating significant drift)
- **Drift Detected**: True

#### Current vs. Reference Distribution
- **Current Distribution**:
  - Small Distribution: 
    - x: [0.829, 1.304, 1.779, 2.254, 2.728, 3.203, 3.678, 4.153, 4.627, 5.102, 5.577]
    - y: [0.105, 0.105, 0.221, 0.232, 0.390, 0.348, 0.358, 0.221, 0.095, 0.032]

- **Reference Distribution**:
  - Small Distribution: 
    - x: [0.0, 0.7, 1.4, 2.1, 2.8, 3.5, 4.2, 4.9, 5.6, 6.3, 7.0]
    - y: [0.014, 0.063, 0.227, 0.0, 0.509, 0.466, 0.0, 0.137, 0.011, 0.002]

#### Insights and Interpretations
The significant drift score of 7.4844 indicates that the distribution of the Physical Activity feature has changed considerably between the reference and current datasets. This drift could potentially lead to a decrease in model performance, as the model may not generalize well to the new distribution of physical activity levels.

### 2.2. SHAP Values Analysis (get_shap_values)

#### Detailed Analysis of Results
The SHAP values were calculated to understand the average impact of the Physical Activity feature on the model's predictions. The mean absolute SHAP values provide insights into feature importance and can indicate feature attribution drift.

- **Reference Mean(|SHAP value|)**: 0.0982 (Rank Position: 2)
- **Current Mean(|SHAP value|)**: 0.0773 (Rank Position: 3)

#### Insights and Interpretations
The decrease in the mean absolute SHAP value from 0.0982 to 0.0773 suggests that the importance of the Physical Activity feature in predicting chronic conditions has diminished in the current dataset compared to the reference dataset. This change in rank position from 2 to 3 further emphasizes the potential shift in feature importance, which may be attributed to the observed data drift.

## 3. Overall Feature Analysis

### Summary of Key Findings
The analysis of the Physical Activity feature reveals significant insights:

1. **Data Drift Detected**: The Kullback-Leibler divergence indicates a substantial change in the distribution of the Physical Activity feature, which could adversely affect model performance.

2. **Decreased Feature Importance**: The SHAP values analysis shows a reduction in the average impact of the Physical Activity feature on model predictions, suggesting that its relevance may have diminished in the current dataset.

3. **Implications for Model Performance**: The combination of detected drift and reduced feature importance necessitates a review of the model's training data and potentially retraining the model to accommodate the new distribution of physical activity levels.

In conclusion, the findings underscore the importance of continuous monitoring of feature distributions and their impacts on model performance, particularly in the context of chronic condition prediction.
