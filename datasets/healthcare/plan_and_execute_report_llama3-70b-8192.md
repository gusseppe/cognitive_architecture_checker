**Columns without Drift**

The following columns do not show significant changes between the reference and current datasets:

1. **Age**: The drift score is 0.03778629771302727, which is below the threshold of 0.1, indicating no significant change in the distribution of Age values.
2. **Diet Quality**: The drift score is 0.0018915553873695345, which is below the threshold of 0.1, indicating no significant change in the distribution of Diet Quality values.
3. **Family History**: The drift score is 0.005370730255683034, which is below the threshold of 0.1, indicating no significant change in the distribution of Family History values.

**SHAP Values Report**

The SHAP values report highlights the feature importance for the current dataset.

**Top Features by SHAP Values**

The top features by SHAP values are:

1. **BMI**: With a SHAP value of 0.16781096493974235, BMI is the most important feature in the current dataset.
2. **Income**: With a SHAP value of 0.12549868716954315, Income is the second most important feature in the current dataset.
3. **Physical Activity**: With a SHAP value of 0.07730394004727022, Physical Activity is the third most important feature in the current dataset.

**Conclusion**

The drift detection report highlights significant changes in the distribution of several columns, including BMI, Blood Pressure, Cholesterol, Income, Physical Activity, Education Level, and Smoking Status. The SHAP values report highlights the importance of BMI, Income, and Physical Activity in the current dataset. These insights can inform data quality monitoring and model retraining efforts.
