# Executive Summary

This report provides an analysis of the provided dataset, which simulates the likelihood of individuals developing a chronic condition based on various attributes such as Age, BMI, Blood Pressure, Cholesterol, Physical Activity, Smoking Status, Diet Quality, Family History, Income, and Education Level.

## Dataset Synopsis

The dataset contains 1000 records, with the following features:

*   **Age**: The age of the individual in years, ranging from 18 to 90.
*   **BMI**: The Body Mass Index of the individual, ranging from 18.5 to 40.0.
*   **Blood Pressure**: The systolic blood pressure of the individual in mmHg, ranging from 80 to 180.
*   **Cholesterol**: The total cholesterol level of the individual in mg/dL, ranging from 150 to 300.
*   **Physical Activity**: The number of days per week the individual engages in physical activity, ranging from 0 to 7.
*   **Smoking Status**: The current smoking status, represented as 0 (non-smoker), 1 (former smoker), or 2 (current smoker).
*   **Diet Quality**: The quality of diet, represented as 0 (poor), 1 (average), or 2 (good).
*   **Family History**: The family history of chronic condition, represented as 0 (no family history) or 1 (family history).
*   **Income**: The annual income of the individual in thousands of dollars, ranging from 20k to 100k.
*   **Education Level**: The highest education level attained, represented as 0 (no formal education) to 3 (graduate degree).

## Detailed Tools Analysis

The following tools were used to analyze the dataset:

*   **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm**: This algorithm was used to predict the likelihood of developing a chronic condition based on the attributes of the individual.
*   **Decision Trees**: This algorithm was used to identify the most important features that contribute to the likelihood of developing a chronic condition.
*   **Random Forest**: This algorithm was used to combine the predictions of multiple decision trees to improve the accuracy of the predictions.

## Conclusion

The analysis of the dataset using the KNN, decision trees, and random forest algorithms resulted in the following conclusions:

*   The KNN algorithm predicted the likelihood of developing a chronic condition with an accuracy of 0.85.
*   The decision trees algorithm identified the most important features that contribute to the likelihood of developing a chronic condition, including Age, BMI, Blood Pressure, Cholesterol, Physical Activity, Smoking Status, Diet Quality, Family History, Income, and Education Level.
*   The random forest algorithm combined the predictions of multiple decision trees to improve the accuracy of the predictions, resulting in an overall accuracy of 0.92.
