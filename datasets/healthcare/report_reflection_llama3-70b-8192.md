**Executive Summary**
=====================

The Chronic Condition Prediction Data is a valuable resource for predicting the likelihood of individuals developing a chronic condition. Our analysis reveals that several features have drifted significantly, including BMI, Blood Pressure, and Income, which may impact model performance. Furthermore, the SHAP values analysis highlights the importance of BMI, Income, and Physical Activity in predicting chronic conditions. These insights are crucial for refining the model and improving its accuracy.
