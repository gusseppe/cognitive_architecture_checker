The comprehensive monitoring report indicates that several features have experienced significant drift, including **Employment Length**, **Income**, **Interest Rate**, **Home Ownership**, **Marital Status**, and **Dependents**. The SHAP analysis shows that **Income** and **Marital Status** have increased in importance, while features like **Loan Term**, **Age**, and **Interest Rate** have decreased in importance. This suggests a shift in the underlying data distribution and feature relevance, which should be considered in future modeling efforts.
