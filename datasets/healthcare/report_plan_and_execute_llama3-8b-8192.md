**Comprehensive Monitoring Report on Dataset Changes**

**Introduction**

This report provides an analysis of the changes detected in the dataset using the GetDriftReport and GetSHAPValues tools. The report aims to identify the columns that have undergone significant changes and provide insights into the nature of these changes.

**Drift Detection**

The GetDriftReport tool was used to detect changes in the distribution of the dataset. The results are presented below:

| Column Name | Column Type | Stat Test Name | Stat Test Threshold | Drift Score | Drift Detected |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| BMI | num | Kullback-Leibler divergence | 0.1 | 0.11257326919665277 | True |
| Blood Pressure | num | Kullback-Leibler divergence | 0.1 | 0.3295963763250584 | True |
| Cholesterol | num | Kullback-Leibler divergence | 0.1 | 0.23450676168929094 | True |
| Income | num | Kullback-Leibler divergence | 0.1 | 0.91626108741935 | True |
| Physical Activity | num | Kullback-Leibler divergence | 0.1 | 7.48442577690803 | True |
| Smoking Status | cat | Kullback-Leibler divergence | 0.1 | 0.20183373734484897 | True |
| Education Level | cat | Kullback-Leibler divergence | 0.1 | 1.6716891527291513 | True |
| Diet Quality | cat | Kullback-Leibler divergence | 0.1 | 0.0018915553873695345 | False |
| Family History | cat | Kullback-Leibler divergence | 0.1 | 0.005370730255683034 | False |
| Age | num | Kullback-Leibler divergence | 0.1 | 0.03778629771302727 | False |

The results show that the following columns have undergone significant changes:

* BMI
* Blood Pressure
* Cholesterol
* Income
* Physical Activity
* Smoking Status
* Education Level

These columns have a drift score greater than the threshold value of 0.1, indicating that their distributions have changed significantly.

**SHAP Values**

The GetSHAPValues tool was used to calculate the SHAP values for each column. The results are presented below:

| Column Name | Reference Value | Current Value | Position |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| BMI | 0.14121425129867368 | 0.16781096493974235 | 1 |
| Physical Activity | 0.09817662833236682 | 0.07730394004727022 | 3 |
| Age | 0.08906002648096621 | 0.050937679805919664 | 5 |
| Blood Pressure | 0.07114418923716576 | 0.053554968593565636 | 4 |
| Income | 0.06594070343394506 | 0.12549868716954315 | 2 |
| Cholesterol | 0.03926329553692529 | 0.04945714499086426 | 6 |
| Family History | 0.01724435122228072 | 0.018126868998631664 | 7 |
| Education Level | 0.016434074575538762 | 0.01641983309158441 | 8 |
| Diet Quality | 0.013835053054035294 | 0.011401517327642103 | 9 |
| Smoking Status | 0.006457749486556214 | 0.004061665409373835 | 10 |

The results show that the SHAP values for the columns that have undergone significant changes are:

* BMI: The current value is higher than the reference value, indicating that the distribution of BMI has shifted towards higher values.
* Income: The current value is higher than the reference value, indicating that the distribution of income has shifted towards higher values.
* Physical Activity: The current value is lower than the reference value, indicating that the distribution of physical activity has shifted towards lower values.
* Age: The current value is lower than the reference value, indicating that the distribution of age has shifted towards lower values.

**Conclusion**

The results of the drift detection and SHAP value analysis indicate that the following columns have undergone significant changes:

* BMI
* Income
* Physical Activity
* Age
* Blood Pressure
* Cholesterol
* Smoking Status
* Education Level

These changes may be indicative of changes in the underlying distribution of the data. Further analysis is recommended to understand the nature and implications of these changes.
