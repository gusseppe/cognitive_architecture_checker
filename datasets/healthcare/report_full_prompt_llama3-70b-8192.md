**Executive Summary**
======================

This report provides an analysis of a dataset related to chronic condition prediction. The dataset contains 10 features, including Age, BMI, Blood Pressure, Cholesterol, Physical Activity, Smoking Status, Diet Quality, Family History, Income, and Education Level, with the target variable being the likelihood of developing a chronic condition. The report includes an overview of the dataset, a detailed analysis of each feature, and the results of drift detection and SHAP value calculations.

**Dataset Synopsis**
=====================

The dataset consists of 10 features, which can be categorized into numerical and categorical features. The numerical features include Age, BMI, Blood Pressure, Cholesterol, Physical Activity, and Income, while the categorical features include Smoking Status, Diet Quality, Family History, and Education Level. The dataset contains 1000 samples, and the target variable is the ChronicCondition label, which indicates the likelihood of developing a chronic condition.

**Tools Analysis**
================

### Drift Detection

Drift detection was performed using the Kullback-Leibler divergence test, with a threshold of 0.1. The results show that the following features have drifted:

* BMI (drift score: 0.11257326919665277)
* Blood Pressure (drift score: 0.3295963763250584)
* Cholesterol (drift score: 0.23450676168929094)
* Income (drift score: 0.91626108741935)
* Physical Activity (drift score: 7.48442577690803)
* Smoking Status (drift score: 0.20183373734484897)
* Education Level (drift score: 1.6716891527291513)

The remaining features did not show significant drift.

### SHAP Values

SHAP values were calculated for each feature to quantify their importance in predicting the ChronicCondition label. The results show that the top 3 features with the highest SHAP values are:

* Income (SHAP value: 0.12549868716954315)
* Physical Activity (SHAP value: 0.07730394004727022)
* BMI (SHAP value: 0.16781096493974235)

The remaining features have lower SHAP values, indicating less importance in predicting the ChronicCondition label.

**Conclusion**
============

In conclusion, the drift detection analysis revealed that several features have drifted significantly, which may impact the performance of machine learning models. The SHAP value analysis highlighted the importance of Income, Physical Activity, and BMI in predicting the ChronicCondition label. These insights can be used to refine the dataset and improve the accuracy of chronic condition prediction models.
