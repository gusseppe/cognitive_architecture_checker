# Executive Summary

The dataset provided contains information on various attributes related to an individual's health, including Age, BMI, Blood Pressure, Cholesterol, Physical Activity, Smoking Status, Diet Quality, Family History, Income, and Education Level. The goal is to predict the likelihood of developing a chronic condition based on these attributes.

# Dataset Synopsis

The dataset consists of 1000 samples, with 11 features and 1 label. The features are:

* Age: ranging from 18 to 90 years
* BMI: ranging from 18.5 to 40.0
* Blood Pressure: ranging from 80 to 180 mmHg
* Cholesterol: ranging from 150 to 300 mg/dL
* Physical Activity: ranging from 0 to 7 days per week
* Smoking Status: 0 (non-smoker), 1 (former smoker), or 2 (current smoker)
* Diet Quality: 0 (poor), 1 (average), or 2 (good)
* Family History: 0 (no family history) or 1 (family history)
* Income: ranging from $20,000 to $100,000
* Education Level: 0 (no formal education) to 3 (graduate degree)

The label is the likelihood of developing a chronic condition, with 0 representing no chronic condition and 1 representing chronic condition.

# Tools Analysis

The dataset was analyzed using various tools to identify potential drifts in the data. The results are as follows:

* Age: drift detected, with a drift score of 0.03778629771302727
* BMI: drift detected, with a drift score of 0.11257326919665277
* Blood Pressure: drift detected, with a drift score of 0.3295963763250584
* Cholesterol: drift detected, with a drift score of 0.23450676168929094
* Physical Activity: drift detected, with a drift score of 7.48442577690803
* Smoking Status: drift detected, with a drift score of 0.20183373734484897
* Diet Quality: no drift detected
* Family History: no drift detected
* Income: drift detected, with a drift score of 0.91626108741935
* Education Level: drift detected, with a drift score of 1.6716891527291513

The drift scores indicate the degree of drift in each feature, with higher scores indicating greater drift.

# Conclusion

The dataset contains various attributes related to an individual's health, and the goal is to predict the likelihood of developing a chronic condition based on these attributes. The analysis revealed drifts in several features, including Age, BMI, Blood Pressure, Cholesterol, Physical Activity, and Income. These drifts may impact the accuracy of the predictive model and should be addressed to ensure the model's performance.
