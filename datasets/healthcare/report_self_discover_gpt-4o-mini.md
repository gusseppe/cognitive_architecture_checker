    "Step 1": {
        "Action": "Define the objective of the report",
        "Details": "The objective of this report is to analyze the likelihood of loan defaults using the provided dataset, focusing on identifying trends and potential risk factors associated with loan defaults."
    },
    "Step 2": {
        "Action": "Summarize the dataset",
        "Details": "The dataset is titled 'Loan Default Prediction Data'. It simulates the likelihood of borrowers defaulting on a loan based on various attributes such as Age, Income, Credit Score, Loan Amount, Loan Term, Interest Rate, Employment Length, Home Ownership, Marital Status, and Dependents. The 'Loan Default' variable serves as the label, indicating whether a borrower is likely (1) or not likely (0) to default on the loan."
    },
    "Step 3": {
        "Action": "Identify key assumptions",
        "Details": "Key assumptions include the reliability of the data collected, the relevance of the features in predicting loan defaults, and the assumption that the distributions of the current and reference datasets are comparable."
    },
    "Step 4": {
        "Action": "Conduct data analysis",
        "Details": "A detailed examination of the dataset was performed using Kullback-Leibler divergence to assess feature drift. The analysis revealed that while some features like Age, Credit Score, and Loan Amount showed no significant drift, features such as Employment Length, Income, Interest Rate, Home Ownership, Marital Status, and Dependents exhibited significant drift."
    },
    "Step 5": {
        "Action": "Analyze tool results",
        "Details": "The Kullback-Leibler divergence results indicated that Employment Length, Income, Interest Rate, Home Ownership, Marital Status, and Dependents have drift scores exceeding the threshold of 0.1, suggesting a change in the distribution of these features over time, which could impact the model's predictive performance."
    },
    "Step 6": {
        "Action": "Simplify findings",
        "Details": "The analysis highlighted that while most numerical features remain stable, significant drift was detected in Employment Length, Income, Interest Rate, Home Ownership, Marital Status, and Dependents, indicating potential shifts in borrower profiles that could affect default predictions."
    },
    "Step 7": {
        "Action": "Discuss long-term implications",
        "Details": "The findings suggest that lenders may need to recalibrate their models to account for the changing borrower demographics and economic conditions reflected in the drifted features. This could lead to more accurate risk assessments and better loan management strategies."
    },
    "Step 8": {
        "Action": "Define metrics for success",
        "Details": "Success metrics include the accuracy of loan default predictions post-model recalibration, the reduction in false positives and negatives in default predictions, and the overall improvement in loan performance metrics."
    },
    "Step 9": {
        "Action": "Incorporate stakeholder perspectives",
        "Details": "Stakeholders, including lenders and risk managers, should be consulted to understand their concerns regarding the changing borrower profiles and how these changes may impact their lending strategies and risk assessments."
    },
    "Step 10": {
        "Action": "Draft the executive summary",
        "Details": "This report analyzes the likelihood of loan defaults based on a dataset that includes various borrower attributes. The analysis reveals significant drift in several key features, indicating a need for model recalibration to maintain predictive accuracy. Recommendations for stakeholders include adjusting lending strategies to align with the evolving borrower landscape."
    },
    "Step 11": {
        "Action": "Compile the detailed tools analysis",
        "Details": "The tools analysis using Kullback-Leibler divergence showed drift in Employment Length (0.104), Income (0.130), Interest Rate (0.122), Home Ownership (0.185), Marital Status (5.656), and Dependents (0.129). These findings suggest that the distributions of these features have changed significantly, which could impact the model's performance."
    },
    "Step 12": {
        "Action": "Write the conclusion",
        "Details": "In conclusion, the analysis indicates that while some features remain stable, significant drift in key borrower attributes necessitates a review and potential recalibration of loan default prediction models. Stakeholders should consider these findings to enhance their risk assessment processes and adapt to the changing lending environment."
