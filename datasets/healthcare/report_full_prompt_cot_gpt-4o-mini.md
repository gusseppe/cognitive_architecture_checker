# Comprehensive Report on Chronic Condition Prediction Data

## Executive Summary
This report provides an in-depth analysis of the Chronic Condition Prediction dataset, which simulates the likelihood of individuals developing chronic conditions based on various health and demographic attributes. The dataset includes both numerical and categorical features, with a total of 1000 samples. The analysis focuses on detecting data drift using Kullback-Leibler divergence, evaluating the significance of feature distributions, and understanding the implications of these findings for predictive modeling.

- **Categorical Features**: 
  - Smoking Status (int)
  - Diet Quality (int)
  - Family History (int)
  - Education Level (int)

- **Label**: 
  - ChronicCondition (int) - Indicates whether an individual is likely (1) or not likely (0) to develop a chronic condition.

### Feature Descriptions

- **BMI**: Ranges from 18.5 to 40.0.
- **Blood Pressure**: Ranges from 80 to 180 mmHg.
- **Cholesterol**: Ranges from 150 to 300 mg/dL.
- **Physical Activity**: Ranges from 0 to 7 days per week.
- **Smoking Status**: 0 (Non-smoker), 1 (Former smoker), 2 (Current smoker).
- **Diet Quality**: 0 (Poor), 1 (Average), 2 (Good).
- **Family History**: 0 (No family history), 1 (Family history).
- **Income**: Ranges from $20,000 to $100,000.
- **Education Level**: 0 (No formal education), 1 (High school diploma), 2 (Bachelor degree), 3 (Graduate degree).

## Detailed Tools Analysis
### Data Drift Analysis
The analysis of data drift was conducted using Kullback-Leibler divergence, which measures the difference between two probability distributions. The following features exhibited significant drift:

1. **BMI**
   - Drift Score: 0.1126 (Drift Detected)
   - Current Distribution: More concentrated in lower BMI values compared to the reference distribution.

2. **Blood Pressure**
   - Drift Score: 0.3296 (Drift Detected)
   - Current Distribution: Shifted towards higher blood pressure values.

3. **Cholesterol**
   - Drift Score: 0.2345 (Drift Detected)
   - Current Distribution: Higher concentration in the mid-range cholesterol levels.

4. **Income**
   - Drift Score: 0.9163 (Drift Detected)
   - Current Distribution: Significantly different from the reference, indicating a shift towards higher income levels.

5. **Physical Activity**
   - Drift Score: 7.4844 (Drift Detected)
   - Current Distribution: Indicates a substantial increase in reported physical activity.

### Features Without Drift
- **Age**: Drift Score: 0.0378 (No Drift Detected)
- **Diet Quality**: Drift Score: 0.0019 (No Drift Detected)
- **Family History**: Drift Score: 0.0054 (No Drift Detected)
- **Smoking Status**: Drift Score: 0.2018 (Drift Detected)

### SHAP Values Analysis
SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values were computed to understand the contribution of each feature to the model's predictions. The following insights were observed:

- **Income**: Increased from 0.0659 (reference) to 0.1255 (current), indicating a higher influence on the prediction.
- **BMI**: Slight increase in influence from 0.1412 to 0.1678.
- **Physical Activity**: Decreased influence from 0.0982 to 0.0773.

## Conclusion
The Chronic Condition Prediction dataset provides valuable insights into the factors influencing the likelihood of developing chronic conditions. The analysis revealed significant data drift in several key features, particularly BMI, Blood Pressure, Cholesterol, Income, and Physical Activity. These findings suggest that the underlying population characteristics may have changed, which could impact the performance of predictive models trained on historical data.

It is recommended to regularly monitor these features for drift and consider retraining models to ensure they remain accurate and relevant. Additionally, further investigation into the causes of drift, particularly in income and physical activity, may provide actionable insights for public health initiatives.
