**Comprehensive Monitoring Report on Dataset Changes**

**Introduction**

This report provides an overview of the changes detected in the dataset over time. The report is based on the results of the `GetDriftReport` and `GetSHAPValues` tools.

**Drift Detection**

The `GetDriftReport` tool was used to detect changes in the distribution of the dataset. The results are shown in the table below:

| Column Name | Drift Score | Drift Detected |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Humidity | 0.140888546876185 | True |
| Precipitation | 0.25888009680491947 | True |
| Temperature | 0.054309298861740365 | False |
| Wind Speed | 0.1040820631397462 | True |
| Weather Condition | 0.5537326308471167 | True |

The results show that the `Humidity`, `Precipitation`, `Wind Speed`, and `Weather Condition` columns have detected changes in their distributions, while the `Temperature` column has not.

**SHAP Values**

The `GetSHAPValues` tool was used to calculate the SHAP values for each feature. The results are shown in the table below:

| Column Name | Reference Value | Current Value | Position |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Weather Condition | 0.1825292530300623 | 0.175580806202321 | 1 |
| Temperature | 0.14850434817298516 | 0.12965245567725245 | 2 |
| Wind Speed | 0.11591288394818361 | 0.11466833382199101 | 3 |
| Humidity | 0.08586330670105281 | 0.0941567826195695 | 4 |
| Precipitation | 0.03740719544154864 | 0.03362271130023157 | 5 |

The results show the SHAP values for each feature, along with the reference and current values, and the position of each feature in the dataset.

**Conclusion**

The results of the `GetDriftReport` and `GetSHAPValues` tools indicate that changes have occurred in the distributions of the `Humidity`, `Precipitation`, `Wind Speed`, and `Weather Condition` columns. The `Temperature` column has not detected any changes. The SHAP values provide additional insights into the relationships between the features and the target variable.

**Recommendations**

Based on the results of this report, it is recommended that the dataset be re-trained and re-evaluated to ensure that the changes in the distributions of the `Humidity`, `Precipitation`, `Wind Speed`, and `Weather Condition` columns do not affect the performance of the model. Additionally, the SHAP values can be used to identify the most important features and to improve the model's performance.
