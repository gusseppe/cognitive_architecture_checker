# Comprehensive Report

## Executive Summary

This report provides an in-depth analysis of weather patterns simulation data. The dataset contains various features such as Temperature, Humidity, Wind Speed, Precipitation, and Weather Condition, with 'Severe Weather' as the label variable. We analyzed the distribution drift and feature attribution using Kullback-Leibler divergence and Tree SHAP methods, respectively. The findings indicate the presence of drift in Humidity, Wind Speed, Precipitation, and Weather Condition features, while no significant drift was detected in Temperature. SHAP values were used to understand the feature importance in predicting severe weather.

## Dataset Synopsis
**Title**: Weather Patterns Simulation Data  
**Features Analyzed**: Temperature, Humidity, Wind Speed, Precipitation, Weather Condition  
**Label Variable**: Severe Weather  

This dataset simulates weather patterns focusing on attributes such as Temperature, Humidity, Wind Speed, Precipitation, and Weather Condition. The 'Severe Weather' variable serves as the label, indicating whether there is a severe weather condition (1) or not (0). 

## Label Description
**Severe Weather**: Indicates the presence of severe weather, with 0 representing no severe weather and 1 representing severe weather.
The label does not show any issues as it clearly distinguishes between severe weather and non-severe weather conditions. However, it was not included in the drift analysis and SHAP values, focusing only on the features for those analyses.
