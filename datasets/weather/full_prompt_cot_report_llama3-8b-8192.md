# Executive Summary
The dataset provided is a simulation of weather patterns, focusing on attributes such as Temperature, Humidity, Wind Speed, Precipitation, and Weather Condition. The dataset is used to predict whether there is a severe weather condition (1) or not (0).

# Dataset Synopsis
The dataset contains 1000 samples with 5 numerical features (Temperature, Humidity, Wind Speed, Precipitation) and 1 categorical feature (Weather Condition). The categorical feature has 5 categories: Clear, Cloudy, Rain, Snow, and Storm.

# Detailed Tools Analysis
The dataset is analyzed using various tools to detect drift in the data. The results show that there is drift in the data, specifically in the features Temperature, Humidity, Wind Speed, and Precipitation. The drift score for each feature is as follows:

* Temperature: 0.054309298861740365
* Humidity: 0.140888546876185
* Wind Speed: 0.1040820631397462
* Precipitation: 0.25888009680491947

The drift score is calculated using the Kullback-Leibler divergence test. The test is used to compare the distribution of the data in the current dataset with the reference distribution.

# Conclusion
The analysis of the dataset reveals that there is drift in the data, specifically in the numerical features. The drift score for each feature is calculated using the Kullback-Leibler divergence test. The results show that there is a significant difference between the current distribution of the data and the reference distribution. This suggests that the data is drifting over time, and it is necessary to update the model to adapt to the changing distribution of the data.
