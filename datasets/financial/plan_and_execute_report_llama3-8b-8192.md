**Comprehensive Monitoring Report on Dataset Changes**

**Introduction**

This report provides an overview of the changes detected in the dataset over time. The analysis is based on the GetDriftReport and GetSHAPValues tools, which provide insights into the drift scores and SHAP values of the features in the dataset.

**Drift Detection**

The GetDriftReport tool was used to detect changes in the distribution of the features in the dataset. The results are presented in the table below:

| Column Name | Drift Score | Drift Detected |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Age | 0.03883719590118 | False |
| Credit Score | 0.0778065393961156 | False |
| Employment Length | 0.10422809774139326 | True |
| Income | 0.130772018665271 | True |
| Interest Rate | 0.12211093048448328 | True |
| Loan Amount | 0.06465984187565631 | False |
| Loan Term | 0.06991922445224397 | False |
| Home Ownership | 0.18557356469873026 | True |
| Marital Status | 5.655843738731566 | True |
| Dependents | 0.1290888567959812 | True |

The results show that the following columns have detected drift: Employment Length, Income, Interest Rate, Home Ownership, Marital Status, and Dependents.

**SHAP Values**

The GetSHAPValues tool was used to calculate the SHAP values for each feature in the dataset. The results are presented in the table below:

| Column Name | Reference Value | Current Value | Position |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Income | 0.13983600738410132 | 0.1676025103420878 | 1 |
| Loan Term | 0.10786701225337081 | 0.08865791016936486 | 2 |
| Age | 0.08155174483476563 | 0.05350981388279517 | 5 |
| Employment Length | 0.07748587080834744 | 0.07723764793746474 | 3 |
| Credit Score | 0.057266813197127224 | 0.05259014360839969 | 6 |
| Marital Status | 0.041422401537971096 | 0.07354211915327408 | 4 |
| Loan Amount | 0.03091725874540736 | 0.030296443826883252 | 7 |
| Interest Rate | 0.02195194757664086 | 0.017982049611167866 | 9 |
| Dependents | 0.02095623100403098 | 0.01848637683404379 | 8 |
| Home Ownership | 0.003640297286226866 | 0.003270709366873879 | 10 |

The results show that the SHAP values have changed significantly for the following columns: Income, Loan Term, Age, Employment Length, Credit Score, Marital Status, Loan Amount, Interest Rate, Dependents, and Home Ownership.

**Conclusion**

The analysis reveals that the dataset has undergone significant changes over time. The drift detection results show that the distributions of the features have changed, and the SHAP values have also changed significantly. These changes may indicate that the underlying relationships between the features have changed, which may impact the accuracy of the models trained on this dataset. Further analysis and monitoring are recommended to understand the implications of these changes.
