Thought: Based on the drift report and SHAP values, it appears that there are significant changes in the distributions of 'Employment Length', 'Income', 'Interest Rate', 'Home Ownership', 'Marital Status', and 'Dependents'. The SHAP values also indicate that the feature importance in both datasets is different, with 'Income', 'Loan Term', 'Age', 'Employment Length', and 'Marital Status' being the top features in the current dataset, and 'Income', 'Loan Term', 'Age', 'Employment Length', and 'Credit Score' being the top features in the reference dataset.

Action: Generate a comprehensive monitoring report based on the drift report and SHAP values.
