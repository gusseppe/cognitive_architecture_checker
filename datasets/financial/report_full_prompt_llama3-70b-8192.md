**Executive Summary**
======================

This report provides an analysis of a loan default prediction dataset, which includes various attributes such as Age, Income, Credit Score, Loan Amount, Loan Term, Interest Rate, Employment Length, Home Ownership, Marital Status, and Dependents. The dataset is used to predict the likelihood of borrowers defaulting on a loan. The report includes a dataset synopsis, tools analysis, and conclusion.

**Dataset Synopsis**
=====================

The dataset consists of 10 features, including 7 numerical features (Age, Income, Credit Score, Loan Amount, Loan Term, Interest Rate, and Employment Length) and 3 categorical features (Home Ownership, Marital Status, and Dependents). The label variable is Loan Default, which indicates whether a borrower is likely to default on a loan (1) or not (0).

**Tools Analysis**
=====================

The tools analysis includes the results of the get_drift_report and get_shap_values functions.

### get_drift_report

The get_drift_report function calculates the drift score and detects drift for each feature in the dataset. The results show that the features with the highest drift scores are Marital Status, Dependents, Income, Interest Rate, and Employment Length, indicating that these features have undergone significant changes between the reference and current distributions.

### get_shap_values

The get_shap_values function calculates the SHAP values for each feature in the dataset. The results show that the most important features contributing to the loan default prediction are Income, Loan Term, Age, Employment Length, and Marital Status.

**Conclusion**
==============

The analysis of the loan default prediction dataset provides insights into the importance of various features in predicting loan defaults. The get_drift_report function highlights the features that have undergone significant changes, while the get_shap_values function identifies the most important features contributing to the prediction. These results can be used to improve the loan default prediction model and reduce the risk of loan defaults.

**Recommendations**
=====================

Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are made:

* Monitor the features with high drift scores (Marital Status, Dependents, Income, Interest Rate, and Employment Length) for further changes and updates.
* Incorporate the most important features (Income, Loan Term, Age, Employment Length, and Marital Status) into the loan default prediction model.
* Continuously update and refine the model to improve its accuracy and reduce the risk of loan defaults.
