Loan Default Prediction Task: Executive Summary
=============================================

The Loan Default Prediction Task involves predicting the likelihood of loan default based on attributes such as Age, Income, Credit Score, Loan Amount, Loan Term, Interest Rate, Employment Length, Home Ownership, Marital Status, and Dependents. The dataset used for this task contains 1000 samples, with 10 features and 1 label.

Dataset Synopsis
-------------

The dataset contains the following features:

*   Age: The age of the borrower in years, ranging from 18 to 70.
*   Income: The annual income of the borrower in dollars, ranging from $20,000 to $150,000.
*   Credit Score: The credit score of the borrower, ranging from 300 to 850.
*   Loan Amount: The loan amount requested by the borrower in dollars, ranging from $1,000 to $50,000.
*   Loan Term: The loan term in months, ranging from 12 to 60.
*   Interest Rate: The interest rate of the loan in percentage, ranging from 3.5% to 25%.
*   Employment Length: The number of years the borrower has been employed, ranging from 0 to 40.
*   Home Ownership: The home ownership status, represented as 0 (Rent), 1 (Own), or 2 (Mortgage).
*   Marital Status: The marital status, represented as 0 (Single), 1 (Married), 2 (Divorced), or 3 (Widowed).
*   Dependents: The number of dependents, ranging from 0 to 5.

The label is the likelihood of loan default, with 0 representing no default and 1 representing default.

Tools Analysis
-------------

The tools used for this task include:

*   Kullback-Leibler divergence: A measure of the difference between two probability distributions.
