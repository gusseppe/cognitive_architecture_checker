**Comprehensive Report**
=======================

**Executive Summary**
--------------------

The provided dataset contains information about loan applicants, including their age, income, credit score, loan amount, loan term, interest rate, employment length, home ownership, marital status, and dependents. The goal is to predict the likelihood of loan default based on these attributes. The dataset has been analyzed using various tools, and the results are presented in this report.

**Dataset Synopsis**
-------------------

The dataset contains 1000 samples with 11 features. The features are categorized into numerical and categorical variables. The numerical features include age, income, credit score, loan amount, loan term, interest rate, and employment length. The categorical features include home ownership, marital status, and dependents.

| Feature | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Age | Numerical | Age of the borrower in years |
| Income | Numerical | Annual income of the borrower in dollars |
| Credit Score | Numerical | Credit score of the borrower |
| Loan Amount | Numerical | Loan amount requested by the borrower in dollars |
| Loan Term | Numerical | Loan term in months |
| Interest Rate | Numerical | Interest rate of the loan in percentage |
| Employment Length | Numerical | Number of years the borrower has been employed |
| Home Ownership | Categorical | Home ownership status (0: Rent, 1: Own, 2: Mortgage) |
| Marital Status | Categorical | Marital status (0: Single, 1: Married, 2: Divorced, 3: Widowed) |
| Dependents | Categorical | Number of dependents |
| Loan Default | Categorical | Likelihood of loan default (0: No default, 1: Default) |

**Tools Analysis**
-----------------

The dataset has been analyzed using various tools, including drift detection and SHAP values.

### Drift Detection

The drift detection tool has been used to identify any changes in the distribution of the features over time. The results are presented in the following table:

| Feature | Drift Score | Drift Detected |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Age | 0.0388 | False |
| Credit Score | 0.0778 | False |
| Employment Length | 0.1042 | True |
| Income | 0.1307 | True |
| Interest Rate | 0.1221 | True |
| Loan Amount | 0.0647 | False |
| Loan Term | 0.0699 | False |
| Home Ownership | 0.1856 | True |
| Marital Status | 5.6558 | True |
| Dependents | 0.1291 | True |

The results indicate that there are changes in the distribution of the employment length, income, interest rate, home ownership, marital status, and dependents features over time.

### SHAP Values

The SHAP values tool has been used to identify the contribution of each feature to the prediction of loan default. The results are presented in the following table:

| Feature | SHAP Value | Position |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Income | 0.1676 | 1 |
| Loan Term | 0.0887 | 2 |
| Age | 0.0535 | 5 |
| Employment Length | 0.0772 | 3 |
| Credit Score | 0.0526 | 6 |
| Marital Status | 0.0735 | 4 |
| Loan Amount | 0.0303 | 7 |
| Interest Rate | 0.0179 | 9 |
| Dependents | 0.0185 | 8 |
| Home Ownership | 0.0033 | 10 |

The results indicate that the income, loan term, age, employment length, credit score, marital status, loan amount, interest rate, dependents, and home ownership features all contribute to the prediction of loan default.

**Conclusion**
----------

The dataset has been analyzed using various tools, including drift detection and SHAP values. The results indicate that there are changes in the distribution of the employment length, income, interest rate, home ownership, marital status, and dependents features over time. The SHAP values tool has been used to identify the contribution of each feature to the prediction of loan default. The results indicate that all the features contribute to the prediction of loan default. The findings of this report can be used to improve the accuracy of loan default prediction models.

**Recommendations**
------------------

Based on the results of this report, the following recommendations are made:

1.  **Update the model**: Update the loan default prediction model to reflect the changes in the distribution of the employment length, income, interest rate, home ownership, marital status, and dependents features over time.
2.  **Feature engineering**: Perform feature engineering on the dataset to create new features that can improve the accuracy of the loan default prediction model.
3.  **Model selection**: Select a suitable machine learning algorithm for the loan default prediction model based on the results of this report.
4.  **Hyperparameter tuning**: Perform hyperparameter tuning on the loan default prediction model to optimize its performance.

By following these recommendations, the accuracy of the loan default prediction model can be improved, and the risk of loan default can be better managed.
