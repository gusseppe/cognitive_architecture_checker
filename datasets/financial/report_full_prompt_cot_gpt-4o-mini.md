## Detailed Tools Analysis
The analysis of the dataset was conducted using Kullback-Leibler divergence to assess data drift across various features. The results are summarized below:

| Feature            | Drift Score | Drift Detected | Stat Test Threshold |
|--------------------|-------------|----------------|---------------------|
| Age                | 0.0388      | No             | 0.1                 |
| Credit Score       | 0.0778      | No             | 0.1                 |
| Employment Length   | 0.1042      | Yes            | 0.1                 |
| Income             | 0.1308      | Yes            | 0.1                 |
| Interest Rate      | 0.1221      | Yes            | 0.1                 |
| Loan Amount        | 0.0647      | No             | 0.1                 |
| Loan Term          | 0.0699      | No             | 0.1                 |
| Home Ownership     | 0.1856      | Yes            | 0.1                 |
| Marital Status     | 5.6558      | Yes            | 0.1                 |
| Dependents         | 0.1291      | Yes            | 0.1                 |

### Observations
- **Drift Detected**: Significant drift was detected in the following features:
  - Employment Length
  - Income
  - Interest Rate
  - Home Ownership
  - Marital Status
  - Dependents

- **No Drift Detected**: Features such as Age, Credit Score, Loan Amount, and Loan Term showed no significant drift, indicating stability in these variables.

## Conclusion
The analysis of the Loan Default Prediction dataset indicates that while several features are stable, there are critical areas where drift has been detected. Features such as Employment Length, Income, Interest Rate, Home Ownership, Marital Status, and Dependents require further investigation and potential model adjustments to ensure predictive accuracy. Continuous monitoring of these features is essential to maintain the integrity of the loan default prediction model. 

Future work should focus on understanding the causes of drift in the identified features and implementing strategies to mitigate its impact on model performance.
