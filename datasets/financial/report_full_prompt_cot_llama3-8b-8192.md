**Executive Summary**
=====================

The dataset provided contains information about loan applicants, including their demographic and financial characteristics. The goal is to identify the most important features that contribute to the likelihood of loan default. The report presents the results of the analysis, including the detection of drift in some features and the calculation of SHAP values.

**Dataset Synopsis**
==================

The dataset contains 1000 samples with 11 features: Age, Income, Credit Score, Loan Amount, Loan Term, Interest Rate, Employment Length, Home Ownership, Marital Status, Dependents, and Loan Default. The features are categorized as numerical (Age, Income, Credit Score, Loan Amount, Loan Term, Interest Rate, Employment Length) and categorical (Home Ownership, Marital Status, Dependents).

**Tools Analysis**
================

### Numerical Features

* Age: Ranging from 18 to 70 years.
* Income: Ranging from $20,000 to $150,000.
* Credit Score: Ranging from 300 to 850.
* Loan Amount: Ranging from $1,000 to $50,000.
* Loan Term: Ranging from 12 to 60 months.
* Interest Rate: Ranging from 3.5% to 25%.
* Employment Length: Ranging from 0 to 40 years.

### Categorical Features

* Home Ownership: 0 (Rent), 1 (Own), or 2 (Mortgage).
* Marital Status: 0 (Single), 1 (Married), 2 (Divorced), or 3 (Widowed).
* Dependents: Ranging from 0 to 5.

### SHAP Values

The SHAP values indicate the contribution of each feature to the likelihood of loan default. The top features contributing to loan default are:

1. Income
2. Loan Term
3. Age
4. Employment Length
5. Credit Score

**Drift Detection**
================

The drift detection results show that the following features have detected drift:

* Employment Length
* Income
* Credit Score

These features have changed significantly over time, which may affect the accuracy of the model.

**Conclusion**
==========

In conclusion, the analysis of the dataset reveals that the most important features contributing to loan default are Income, Loan Term, Age, Employment Length, and Credit Score. The drift detection results indicate that Employment Length, Income, and Credit Score have changed significantly over time, which may impact the accuracy of the model. Further analysis and modeling are needed to develop a robust loan default prediction model.
