**Executive Summary**
The dataset provided is a loan default prediction dataset, which aims to predict the likelihood of borrowers defaulting on a loan based on various attributes such as Age, Income, Credit Score, Loan Amount, Loan Term, Interest Rate, Employment Length, Home Ownership, Marital Status, and Dependents.

**Dataset Synopsis**
The dataset consists of 1000 samples, with 10 features and 1 label. The features are:

* Age: ranging from 18 to 70 years
* Income: ranging from $20,000 to $150,000
* Credit Score: ranging from 300 to 850
* Loan Amount: ranging from $1,000 to $50,000
* Loan Term: ranging from 12 to 60 months
* Interest Rate: ranging from 3.5% to 25%
* Employment Length: ranging from 0 to 40 years
* Home Ownership: categorized as 0 (Rent), 1 (Own), or 2 (Mortgage)
* Marital Status: categorized as 0 (Single), 1 (Married), 2 (Divorced), or 3 (Widowed)
* Dependents: ranging from 0 to 5

The label is "Loan Default", indicating whether a borrower is likely (1) or not likely (0) to default on the loan.
