**Loan Default Prediction Report**
================================

**Executive Summary**
--------------------

The loan default prediction dataset contains 1000 samples with 11 features and 1 label. The features include Age, Income, Credit Score, Loan Amount, Loan Term, Interest Rate, Employment Length, Home Ownership, Marital Status, and Dependents. The label is Loan Default, indicating whether a borrower is likely (1) or not likely (0) to default on the loan.

**Dataset Synopsis**
-------------------

The dataset is simulated to represent the likelihood of borrowers defaulting on a loan based on various attributes. The features are categorized into numerical and categorical variables. The numerical features include Age, Income, Credit Score, Loan Amount, Loan Term, and Interest Rate, while the categorical features include Home Ownership, Marital Status, and Dependents.

**Tools Analysis**
-----------------

The tools results provide information on the dataset, including the number of samples, features, and numerical and categorical features. The column types and values are also provided, along with the dataset title, description, and feature descriptions.

**Drift Detection**
-----------------

The drift detection results show that the drift score is above the threshold for the following features: Employment Length, Income, Credit Score, and Interest Rate. This indicates that there is a significant change in the distribution of these features over time.

**SHAP Values**
--------------

The SHAP values provide an explanation of the feature importance for each sample. The top features contributing to loan default are Income, Loan Term, Age, Employment Length, and Credit Score.

**Conclusion**
----------

Based on the analysis, the most important features contributing to loan default are Income, Loan Term, Age, Employment Length, and Credit Score. The drift detection results indicate that there are significant changes in the distribution of these features over time. The SHAP values provide an explanation of the feature importance for each sample. These findings can be used to develop a loan default prediction model that takes into account the changing distribution of these features.

**Recommendations**
-----------------

1. Develop a loan default prediction model that incorporates the top features contributing to loan default.
2. Monitor the distribution of the features over time to detect any changes that may affect the model's performance.
3. Use SHAP values to explain the feature importance for each sample and identify any biases in the model.

**Limitations**
--------------

1. The dataset is simulated and may not reflect real-world scenarios.
2. The features may not be exhaustive, and additional features may be necessary to improve the model's performance.
3. The model may be biased towards certain features or groups of borrowers.
