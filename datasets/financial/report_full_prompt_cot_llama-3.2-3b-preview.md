**Comprehensive Report: Loan Default Prediction Data**
=====================================================

**Executive Summary**
-------------------

This report provides an analysis of the Loan Default Prediction Data, a simulated dataset used to predict the likelihood of borrowers defaulting on a loan based on various attributes. The dataset contains 1000 samples, each representing a borrower, with 10 features: Age, Income, Credit Score, Loan Amount, Loan Term, Interest Rate, Employment Length, Home Ownership, Marital Status, and Dependents. The report provides an overview of the dataset, tool results, and detailed analysis of the features.

**Dataset Synopsis**
------------------

The Loan Default Prediction Data is a simulated dataset containing 1000 samples, each representing a borrower. The dataset includes 10 features:

*   **Age**: Age of the borrower in years, ranging from 18 to 70.
*   **Income**: Annual income of the borrower in dollars, ranging from $20,000 to $150,000.
*   **Credit Score**: Credit score of the borrower, ranging from 300 to 850.
*   **Loan Amount**: Loan amount requested by the borrower in dollars, ranging from $1,000 to $50,000.
*   **Loan Term**: Loan term in months, ranging from 12 to 60.
*   **Interest Rate**: Interest rate of the loan in percentage, ranging from 3.5% to 25%.
*   **Employment Length**: Number of years the borrower has been employed, ranging from 0 to 40.
*   **Home Ownership**: Home ownership status, represented as 0 (Rent), 1 (Own), or 2 (Mortgage).
*   **Marital Status**: Marital status, represented as 0 (Single), 1 (Married), 2 (Divorced), or 3 (Widowed).
*   **Dependents**: Number of dependents, ranging from 0 to 5.

The dataset also includes a target variable, **Loan Default**, indicating the likelihood of loan default, with 0 representing no default and 1 representing default.
