**Executive Summary**
===============

This report provides an analysis of a loan default prediction dataset, which includes various attributes such as Age, Income, Credit Score, Loan Amount, Loan Term, Interest Rate, Employment Length, Home Ownership, Marital Status, and Dependents. The dataset aims to predict the likelihood of borrowers defaulting on a loan based on these attributes.

**Dataset Synopsis**
===============

The dataset consists of 10 features, including 7 numerical features (Age, Income, Credit Score, Loan Amount, Loan Term, Interest Rate, and Employment Length) and 3 categorical features (Home Ownership, Marital Status, and Dependents). The label variable is Loan Default, which indicates whether a borrower is likely to default on a loan (1) or not (0).

**Detailed Tools Analysis**
==========================

### Drift Detection

The drift detection results show that three features (Employment Length, Income, and Interest Rate) have drifted significantly between the current and reference distributions. This suggests that the underlying data distribution has changed over time, which may impact the performance of machine learning models.

### SHAP Values

The SHAP values analysis provides feature importance scores for each feature in the dataset. The top three features with the highest SHAP values are Income, Loan Term, and Age, indicating that these features have the most significant impact on the loan default prediction.

**Conclusion**
==========

In conclusion, this report provides an overview of the loan default prediction dataset, including its features, drift detection results, and SHAP values analysis. The insights gained from this analysis can be used to improve the performance of machine learning models and better understand the factors contributing to loan defaults.
