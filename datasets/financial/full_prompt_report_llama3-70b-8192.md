**Executive Summary**
===============

This report provides an analysis of a loan default prediction dataset, which includes various attributes such as Age, Income, Credit Score, Loan Amount, Loan Term, Interest Rate, Employment Length, Home Ownership, Marital Status, and Dependents. The dataset aims to predict the likelihood of borrowers defaulting on a loan based on these attributes.

**Dataset Synopsis**
===============

The dataset consists of 10 features, including 7 numerical features (Age, Income, Credit Score, Loan Amount, Loan Term, Interest Rate, and Employment Length) and 3 categorical features (Home Ownership, Marital Status, and Dependents). The label feature is Loan Default, which indicates whether a borrower is likely (1) or not likely (0) to default on the loan.

**Tools Analysis**
===============

The analysis reveals that the dataset has 1000 samples, with a mix of numerical and categorical features. The numerical features have varying ranges, and the categorical features have distinct categories. The label feature, Loan Default, is a binary classification problem.

**Drift Detection**
===============

The drift detection analysis reveals that three features have drifted significantly: Employment Length, Income, and Interest Rate. These features have undergone significant changes between the current and reference distributions, indicating potential issues with data quality or changes in the underlying data generation process.

**SHAP Values**
===============

The SHAP values analysis provides insights into the feature importance for the loan default prediction task. The top features contributing to the prediction are Income, Loan Term, Age, Employment Length, and Marital Status. These features have the highest SHAP values, indicating their significance in predicting loan defaults.

**Conclusion**
===============

In conclusion, this report provides a comprehensive analysis of the loan default prediction dataset. The analysis highlights the importance of feature engineering, data quality, and drift detection in machine learning model development. The insights gained from this analysis can be used to improve the performance of loan default prediction models and inform business decisions in the lending industry.
