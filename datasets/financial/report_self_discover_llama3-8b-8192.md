**Loan Default Prediction Report**
================================

**Executive Summary**
--------------------

The loan default prediction dataset contains 1000 samples with 11 features and 1 label. The features include Age, Income, Credit Score, Loan Amount, Loan Term, Interest Rate, Employment Length, Home Ownership, Marital Status, and Dependents. The label is Loan Default, indicating whether a borrower is likely (1) or not likely (0) to default on the loan.

**Dataset Synopsis**
-------------------

The dataset is simulated to represent the likelihood of borrowers defaulting on a loan based on various attributes. The features are categorized into numerical and categorical variables. The numerical features include Age, Income, Credit Score, Loan Amount, Loan Term, and Interest Rate, while the categorical features include Home Ownership, Marital Status, and Dependents.

**Tools Analysis**
-----------------

The tools results provide an overview of the dataset, including the number of samples, features, and numerical and categorical features. The column types and values are also provided, along with the dataset title, description, and feature descriptions.

**Drift Detection**
-----------------

The drift detection results show that the following features have detected drift: Employment Length, Income, Credit Score, and Interest Rate. This indicates that the distribution of these features has changed over time.

**SHAP Values**
----------------

The SHAP values provide an explanation of the feature importance for each sample. The top features contributing to loan default are:

1. Income
2. Loan Term
3. Age
4. Employment Length
5. Credit Score

**Conclusion**
--------------

In conclusion, the loan default prediction dataset is a simulated dataset that represents the likelihood of borrowers defaulting on a loan based on various attributes. The drift detection results indicate that some features have changed over time, and the SHAP values provide an explanation of the feature importance for each sample. The top features contributing to loan default are Income, Loan Term, Age, Employment Length, and Credit Score.

**Recommendations**
-------------------

Based on the analysis, it is recommended to:

1. Monitor the drift of the features over time to ensure that the model remains accurate.
2. Use the SHAP values to identify the most important features for each sample and adjust the model accordingly.
3. Consider incorporating additional features that may be relevant to loan default prediction.

**Limitations**
--------------

The dataset has some limitations, including:

1. The simulated nature of the data may not accurately represent real-world scenarios.
2. The dataset may not be representative of all loan default scenarios.
3. The model may not generalize well to new data.

**Future Work**
--------------

Future work includes:

1. Collecting and analyzing real-world data to improve the accuracy of the model.
2. Incorporating additional features that may be relevant to loan default prediction.
3. Developing a more robust model that can handle drift and other changes in the data.
