# Comprehensive Report

## Executive Summary

This report analyzes a dataset aimed at predicting loan defaults based on various borrower attributes. Key features include Age, Income, Credit Score, Loan Amount, Loan Term, Interest Rate, Employment Length, Home Ownership, Marital Status, and Dependents. The primary objective is to identify patterns and insights that can help in understanding the likelihood of loan defaults.

## Dataset Synopsis
**Title**: Loan Default Prediction Data  
**Features Analyzed**: Age, Income, Credit Score, Loan Amount, Loan Term, Interest Rate, Employment Length, Home Ownership, Marital Status, Dependents  
**Label Variable**: Loan Default  

This dataset simulates the likelihood of borrowers defaulting on a loan based on attributes such as Age, Income, Credit Score, Loan Amount, Loan Term, Interest Rate, Employment Length, Home Ownership, Marital Status, and Dependents. The 'Loan Default' variable serves as the label, indicating whether a borrower is likely (1) or not likely (0) to default on the loan.

## Label Description
**Loan Default**: Indicates the likelihood of loan default, with 0 representing no default and 1 representing default.
(Here the LLM should provide an explanation if the label has issues or not. Remember that the label was not used in the drift analysis and SHAP values.)

The label 'Loan Default' appears to be well-defined with clear binary outcomes (0 or 1). However, without using it in drift analysis and SHAP values, itâ€™s crucial to ensure the consistency and accuracy of this label during model training and testing.

  - Reference: {'small_distribution': {'x': [0, 1, 2, 3], 'y': [20, 538, 237, 5]}}
  - Interpretation: The current marital status distribution shows a dramatic increase in widowed borrowers, with a significant reduction in single, married, and divorced categories. This indicates a notable demographic shift that could impact loan default risk.

#### Feature Attribution Analysis
  - Method: Tree SHAP
  - Training Data: 0.041422401537971096 (Rank 6)
  - Current Data: 0.07354211915327408 (Rank 4)
  - Interpretation: The SHAP values for marital status have increased, indicating that this feature has become more influential in predicting loan defaults. This shift in importance highlights the changing impact of marital status on borrower risk profiles.

#### Overall Interpretation: 
  Marital status shows significant drift, with a marked increase in widowed borrowers. Its increased SHAP values suggest that marital status is becoming a more critical factor in loan default predictions, potentially due to changes in the financial stability associated with different marital statuses.

### Feature name: Dependents
- **Description**: Number of dependents, ranging from 0 to 5.
- **Type**: Categorical
- **Possible Values**: Ranging from 0 to 5.
- **Data Type**: int

#### Distribution Drift Analysis
- **Statistical Test**: Kullback-Leibler divergence
- **Drift Score**: 0.1290888567959812
- **Detection**: Drift detected
- **Current vs. Reference Distribution**:
  - Current: {'small_distribution': {'x': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 'y': [0, 2, 29, 78, 69, 22]}}
  - Reference: {'small_distribution': {'x': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 'y': [2, 20, 178, 385, 207, 8]}}
  - Interpretation: The current dependents distribution shows a higher concentration of borrowers with 3 or more dependents compared to the reference, which indicates a shift towards larger family sizes among borrowers.

#### Feature Attribution Analysis
  - Method: Tree SHAP
  - Training Data: 0.02095623100403098 (Rank 9)
  - Current Data: 0.01848637683404379 (Rank 8)
  - Interpretation: The SHAP values for dependents have increased slightly, indicating a marginal rise in its influence on loan default predictions. This suggests that the number of dependents is becoming a more relevant factor in assessing borrower risk.

#### Overall Interpretation: 
  Dependents show significant drift, reflecting changes in borrower family sizes. Its slightly increased SHAP values indicate that while still relatively low in impact, the number of dependents is becoming a more important factor in predicting loan defaults.

## Overall Analysis
The dataset shows significant drift in several key features, including Income, Interest Rate, Employment Length, Home Ownership, Marital Status, and Dependents. These drifts indicate shifts in borrower demographics and economic profiles. SHAP value analysis reveals that while some features have maintained their importance, others have become more or less influential in predicting loan defaults. For instance, Income remains the top predictor, whereas features like Marital Status and Dependents have gained importance.

## Conclusion
This analysis highlights the dynamic nature of borrower profiles and the factors influencing loan defaults. The detected drifts suggest that lending institutions need to continuously monitor and adjust their risk assessment models to account for these changes. Understanding the shifting importance of features can help in making more accurate predictions and better-informed lending decisions.
