        ## Details

        ### Label Insight
        Based on the provided information, I will explain the label 'Loan Default' as follows:

The 'Loan Default' label is a categorical variable that indicates the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on a loan. The label takes on two possible values: 0 and 1.

* A value of 0 represents that the borrower is not likely to default on the loan, i.e., there is no default.
* A value of 1 represents that the borrower is likely to default on the loan, i.e., there is a default.

The label is an integer variable, which means it can take on integer values, in this case, 0 or 1. The possible values for the label are 'No default' and 'Default', respectively.

In summary, the 'Loan Default' label is a categorical variable that indicates the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on a loan, with 0 representing no default and 1 representing default.
