    "Step 1": {
        "Task": "Review the dataset information",
        "Action": "The dataset consists of 1000 samples with features including Age, Income, Credit Score, Loan Amount, Loan Term, Interest Rate, Employment Length, Home Ownership, Marital Status, and Dependents. The features are a mix of numerical and categorical types, with specific ranges and distributions for each."
    },
    "Step 2": {
        "Task": "Summarize the dataset",
        "Action": "The dataset titled 'Loan Default Prediction Data' aims to simulate the likelihood of borrowers defaulting on loans based on various attributes. Key features include Age (18-70 years), Income ($20,000-$150,000), Credit Score (300-850), Loan Amount ($1,000-$50,000), Loan Term (12-60 months), Interest Rate (3.5%-25%), Employment Length (0-40 years), Home Ownership (Rent, Own, Mortgage), Marital Status (Single, Married, Divorced, Widowed), and Dependents (0-5). The label indicates loan default status."
    },
    "Step 3": {
        "Task": "Conduct a drift analysis",
        "Action": "Drift analysis reveals that significant drift has been detected in Employment Length, Income, Interest Rate, Home Ownership, Marital Status, and Dependents, with drift scores exceeding the threshold of 0.1. Other features like Age, Credit Score, Loan Amount, and Loan Term show no significant drift."
    },
    "Step 4": {
        "Task": "Analyze the tools results",
        "Action": "The analysis utilized Kullback-Leibler divergence to assess drift across features. The results indicate that the current distributions of Employment Length, Income, Interest Rate, Home Ownership, Marital Status, and Dependents differ significantly from the reference distributions, which may impact the model's predictive performance."
    },
    "Step 5": {
        "Task": "Identify key assumptions",
        "Action": "Assumptions include that the dataset is representative of the population, the features are relevant for predicting loan defaults, and the drift analysis accurately reflects changes in the data distributions over time."
    },
    "Step 6": {
        "Task": "Evaluate risks and drawbacks",
        "Action": "Potential risks include data quality issues, such as missing values or outliers, and representativeness concerns if the dataset does not reflect the current borrower population. Additionally, significant drift in key features may lead to model performance degradation."
    },
    "Step 7": {
        "Task": "Consider long-term implications",
        "Action": "The findings suggest that continuous monitoring of feature distributions is essential for maintaining model accuracy. Adjustments to the model may be necessary to account for detected drifts, particularly in Employment Length and Income, which are critical for predicting loan defaults."
    },
    "Step 8": {
        "Task": "Incorporate stakeholder perspectives",
        "Action": "Stakeholders, including lenders and risk analysts, should be consulted to understand their concerns regarding the model's predictions and the implications of detected drifts. Their insights can guide adjustments to the model and improve its relevance."
    },
    "Step 9": {
        "Task": "Compile the report",
        "Action": "The report will be structured with sections for the executive summary, dataset synopsis, detailed tools analysis, drift analysis results, assumptions, risks, long-term implications, stakeholder perspectives, and conclusions."
    },
    "Step 10": {
        "Task": "Review and finalize the report",
        "Action": "A thorough review will be conducted to ensure clarity, coherence, and completeness of the report, ensuring that all findings and recommendations are well-articulated before finalization."
