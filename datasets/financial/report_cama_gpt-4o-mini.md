        ## Overview
        Overview report

        ## Details

        ### Label Insight
        The label in the "Loan Default Prediction Data" dataset is named "Loan Default." It serves as a categorical variable that indicates the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on a loan. The label has two possible values: 

- **0**: Represents "No default," indicating that the borrower is not likely to default on the loan.
- **1**: Represents "Default," indicating that the borrower is likely to default on the loan.

The data type of this label is an integer (int), which is common for binary classification tasks. The label is crucial for training predictive models, as it provides the target outcome that the model aims to predict based on various borrower attributes such as Age, Income, Credit Score, and others.

In terms of potential issues with the label, it is important to ensure that the dataset is balanced, meaning that the number of instances of each class (0s and 1s) should be relatively equal. An imbalanced dataset could lead to biased predictions, where the model may perform well on the majority class but poorly on the minority class. Additionally, the label should be clearly defined and consistently applied across the dataset to avoid confusion during analysis and model training.

### 2.2 SHAP Values Analysis (get_shap_values)

#### Detailed Analysis of Results
The SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values were calculated to understand the impact of the 'Income' feature on the model's predictions. The results are as follows:

- **Reference SHAP Value**: 0.13983600738410132 (Rank Position: 1)
- **Current SHAP Value**: 0.1676025103420878 (Rank Position: 1)

#### Insights and Interpretations
The SHAP analysis indicates that the 'Income' feature remains the most influential feature in predicting loan default in both the reference and current datasets. However, the increase in the mean absolute SHAP value from the reference to the current dataset suggests that the 'Income' feature has gained more importance in the model's predictions.

- The increase in SHAP value indicates that the model is now attributing a higher impact to the 'Income' feature, which may be a response to the changes in the income distribution observed in the drift report.

## 3. Overall Feature Analysis

### Summary of Key Findings
1. **Data Drift Detected**: The 'Income' feature has experienced significant drift, indicating a change in the distribution of borrower incomes between the reference and current datasets. This drift could adversely affect the model's predictive performance.

2. **Increased Feature Importance**: Despite the drift, the 'Income' feature remains the most significant predictor of loan default, with an increase in its SHAP value suggesting that it has become even more critical in the current dataset.

3. **Implications for Model Performance**: The combination of detected drift and increased feature importance necessitates a review of the model's performance metrics. It may be beneficial to retrain the model with the current dataset to ensure it accurately reflects the new income distribution and maintains predictive accuracy.

In conclusion, while the 'Income' feature continues to be a key predictor, the significant drift observed warrants further investigation and potential model recalibration to adapt to the changing data landscape.
