**Comprehensive Monitoring Report on Dataset Changes**

**Introduction**

This report provides an analysis of the changes detected in the dataset using the GetDriftReport and GetSHAPValues tools. The report aims to identify the columns that have undergone significant changes and assess the impact of these changes on the dataset.

**Drift Detection**

The GetDriftReport tool was used to detect changes in the dataset. The results are presented below:

| Column Name | Column Type | Stat Test Name | Stat Test Threshold | Drift Score | Drift Detected |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Employment Length | num | Kullback-Leibler divergence | 0.1 | 0.10422809774139326 | True |
| Income | num | Kullback-Leibler divergence | 0.1 | 0.130772018665271 | True |
| Interest Rate | num | Kullback-Leibler divergence | 0.1 | 0.12211093048448328 | True |
| Marital Status | cat | Kullback-Leibler divergence | 0.1 | 5.655843738731566 | True |
| Dependents | cat | Kullback-Leibler divergence | 0.1 | 0.1290888567959812 | True |
| Home Ownership | cat | Kullback-Leibler divergence | 0.1 | 0.18557356469873026 | True |

The results indicate that the following columns have undergone significant changes:

* Employment Length
* Income
* Interest Rate
* Marital Status
* Dependents
* Home Ownership

These columns have a drift score greater than the threshold value of 0.1, indicating that the distribution of the data has changed significantly.

**SHAP Values Analysis**

The GetSHAPValues tool was used to analyze the SHAP values for each column. The results are presented below:

| Column Name | Reference Value | Current Value | Position |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Income | 0.13983600738410132 | 0.1676025103420878 | 1 |
| Loan Term | 0.10786701225337081 | 0.08865791016936486 | 2 |
| Age | 0.08155174483476563 | 0.05350981388279517 | 5 |
| Employment Length | 0.07748587080834744 | 0.07723764793746474 | 3 |
| Credit Score | 0.057266813197127224 | 0.05259014360839969 | 6 |
| Marital Status | 0.041422401537971096 | 0.07354211915327408 | 4 |
| Loan Amount | 0.03091725874540736 | 0.030296443826883252 | 7 |
| Interest Rate | 0.02195194757664086 | 0.017982049611167866 | 9 |
| Dependents | 0.02095623100403098 | 0.01848637683404379 | 8 |
| Home Ownership | 0.003640297286226866 | 0.003270709366873879 | 10 |

The results indicate that the SHAP values for the following columns have changed significantly:

* Income
* Marital Status
* Employment Length

These columns have a significant change in their SHAP values, indicating that the model's predictions are being influenced by these columns in a different way.

**Conclusion**

The analysis of the dataset changes using the GetDriftReport and GetSHAPValues tools has identified significant changes in the following columns:

* Employment Length
* Income
* Interest Rate
* Marital Status
* Dependents
* Home Ownership

These changes may have an impact on the model's predictions and accuracy. It is recommended to retrain the model using the updated data to ensure that it is making accurate predictions. Additionally, further analysis is needed to understand the impact of these changes on the model's performance.
