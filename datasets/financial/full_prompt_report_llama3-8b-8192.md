**Executive Summary**
=====================

The dataset provided contains information about borrowers and their likelihood of defaulting on a loan. The dataset includes 11 features: Age, Income, Credit Score, Loan Amount, Loan Term, Interest Rate, Employment Length, Home Ownership, Marital Status, Dependents, and Loan Default. The dataset is simulated to test the performance of machine learning models in predicting loan default.
