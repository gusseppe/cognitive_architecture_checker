**Executive Summary**
=====================

The dataset provided contains information about borrowers and their likelihood of defaulting on a loan. The dataset includes 11 features: Age, Income, Credit Score, Loan Amount, Loan Term, Interest Rate, Employment Length, Home Ownership, Marital Status, Dependents, and Loan Default. The dataset is used to predict the likelihood of loan default.

**Dataset Synopsis**
==================

The dataset contains 1000 samples, with each sample representing a borrower. The features are:

* **Numerical Features**: Age, Income, Credit Score, Loan Amount, Loan Term, Interest Rate, Employment Length
* **Categorical Features**: Home Ownership, Marital Status, Dependents
* **Label**: Loan Default (0 for no default, 1 for default)

**Tools Analysis**
================

The dataset was analyzed using various tools to identify potential drifts in the data. The results are as follows:

* **Drift Detection**: The Kullback-Leibler divergence test was used to detect drifts in the data. The results show that the following features have significant drifts:
	+ Age
	+ Credit Score
	+ Employment Length
	+ Income
	+ Interest Rate
	+ Loan Amount
	+ Loan Term
* **Shap Values**: The SHAP values were calculated to analyze the importance of each feature in predicting loan default. The results show that the most important features are:
	+ Income
	+ Loan Term
	+ Age
	+ Credit Score
	+ Employment Length

**Conclusion**
=============

The analysis of the dataset reveals significant drifts in several features, indicating changes in the underlying distribution of the data. The SHAP values highlight the importance of certain features in predicting loan default. These findings can be used to improve the accuracy of loan default prediction models.
