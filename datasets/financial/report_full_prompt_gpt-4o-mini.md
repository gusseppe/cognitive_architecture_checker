# Comprehensive Report on Loan Default Prediction Data

## Executive Summary
This report provides an in-depth analysis of the Loan Default Prediction dataset, which simulates the likelihood of borrowers defaulting on loans based on various attributes. The dataset includes both numerical and categorical features, with a focus on understanding the distribution of these features and detecting any potential drift in the data. The analysis reveals that while some features exhibit drift, others remain stable, indicating a need for continuous monitoring and potential model retraining.

## Detailed Tools Analysis
The analysis of the dataset was conducted using the Kullback-Leibler divergence to assess the drift in the features. The results are summarized below:

| Feature            | Drift Score | Drift Detected | Stat Test Threshold |
|--------------------|-------------|----------------|---------------------|
| Age                | 0.0388      | No             | 0.1                 |
| Credit Score       | 0.0778      | No             | 0.1                 |
| Employment Length   | 0.1042      | Yes            | 0.1                 |
| Income             | 0.1308      | Yes            | 0.1                 |
| Interest Rate      | 0.1221      | Yes            | 0.1                 |
| Loan Amount        | 0.0647      | No             | 0.1                 |
| Loan Term          | 0.0699      | No             | 0.1                 |
| Home Ownership     | 0.1856      | Yes            | 0.1                 |
| Marital Status     | 5.6558      | Yes            | 0.1                 |
| Dependents         | 0.1291      | Yes            | 0.1                 |

### Observations
- **Drift Detected**: Significant drift was detected in the following features:
  - Employment Length
  - Income
  - Interest Rate
  - Home Ownership
  - Marital Status
  - Dependents

- **No Drift Detected**: Features such as Age, Credit Score, Loan Amount, and Loan Term showed no significant drift, indicating stability in their distributions.

## Conclusion
The analysis of the Loan Default Prediction dataset highlights the importance of monitoring feature distributions over time. While several features remain stable, the detection of drift in key variables such as Employment Length, Income, and Marital Status suggests that the model may require retraining to maintain accuracy. Continuous monitoring and periodic updates to the model will be essential to adapt to changes in the underlying data distributions and ensure reliable predictions of loan defaults.
