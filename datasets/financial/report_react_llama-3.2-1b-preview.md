Thought: Based on the SHAP values, I notice that the feature importance has changed across the datasets. The top features in the current dataset are 'Income', 'Loan Term', 'Employment Length', 'Marital Status', and 'Age', while in the reference dataset, the top features are 'Income', 'Loan Term', 'Age', 'Credit Score', and 'Marital Status'. This suggests that the importance of certain features has changed over time.

Action: None (I'll summarize the findings)
