The monitoring report on dataset changes reveals significant drift in the 'Income', 'Education Level', 'Employment Status', and 'Marital Status' columns, with drift scores above the threshold of 0.1. The 'Age' column does not show significant drift. The SHAP values indicate that 'Income' is the most important feature in both datasets, with a significant increase in importance in the current dataset. The report highlights the need for further investigation into the changes in the 'Income', 'Education Level', 'Employment Status', and 'Marital Status' columns, as well as the impact of these changes on the model's performance.
