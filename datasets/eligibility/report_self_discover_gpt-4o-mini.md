        "Details": "The drift analysis indicates that features such as Income and Employment Status have undergone significant changes, which could lead to misclassification in program eligibility. The SHAP values further highlight the importance of Income in determining eligibility, while the decreasing SHAP value for Age suggests it may be less influential than previously thought."

        "Task": "Formulate the conclusion.",
        "Details": "The findings underscore the necessity for stakeholders to reassess the model used for determining program eligibility. Given the significant drift in key features, it is recommended to update the model to reflect current population characteristics and ensure accurate eligibility assessments."
