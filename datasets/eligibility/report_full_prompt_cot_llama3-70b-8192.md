**Comprehensive Report: Eligibility Simulation Data Analysis**
============================================================

**Executive Summary**
---------------------

This report provides an in-depth analysis of the Eligibility Simulation Data, focusing on the distribution of features and their impact on the program eligibility. The dataset consists of 1000 samples, with five features: Age, Income, Education Level, Employment Status, and Marital Status. The report highlights the drift detection results, SHAP values, and feature descriptions, providing insights into the dataset's characteristics and relationships.

**Dataset Synopsis**
---------------------

### Features

The dataset contains five features:

* **Age**: Numerical feature, ranging from 18 to 65 years.
* **Income**: Numerical feature, ranging from $20,000 to $70,000.
* **Education Level**: Categorical feature, with four categories: No formal education, High school diploma, Bachelor degree, and Graduate degree.
* **Employment Status**: Categorical feature, with three categories: Unemployed, Part-time employment, and Full-time employment.
* **Marital Status**: Categorical feature, with three categories: Single, Married, and Divorced.

### Label

The label variable is **ProgramEligibility**, which indicates whether an individual is eligible (1) or not eligible (0) for the program.

### Drift Detection

The drift detection results are presented below:

| Feature | Drift Score | Drift Detected |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Age | 0.06325575780482698 | False |
| Income | 0.7978008461594442 | True |
| Education Level | 0.1851521399815421 | True |
| Employment Status | 0.7046963105072126 | True |
| Marital Status | 0.8026944167960824 | True |

The results indicate that Income, Education Level, Employment Status, and Marital Status have drifted significantly, while Age has not.

### SHAP Values

The SHAP values are presented below:

| Feature | Reference Value | Current Value | Position |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Income | 0.16902756259348087 | 0.24910130910592299 | 1 |
| Age | 0.1675692700443467 | 0.10098040394127042 | 2 |
| Education Level | 0.11009905271521023 | 0.06845397004237376 | 3 |
| Marital Status | 0.05409217592159332 | 0.09958768447538655 | 4 |
| Employment Status | 0.018275746416542244 | 0.010987271996598626 | 5 |

The SHAP values indicate the feature importance, with Income being the most important feature in the current dataset.

**Conclusion**
----------

The Eligibility Simulation Data analysis reveals that Income, Education Level, Employment Status, and Marital Status have drifted significantly, which may impact the model's performance. The SHAP values highlight the importance of Income and Age in the current dataset. These insights can be used to refine the model and improve its accuracy in predicting program eligibility.
