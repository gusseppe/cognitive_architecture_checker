# Comprehensive Report on Eligibility Simulation Data

## Executive Summary
This report provides an in-depth analysis of the "Eligibility Simulation Data" dataset, which simulates the eligibility of individuals for a specific program based on various demographic and economic attributes. The analysis focuses on detecting data drift in key features such as Age, Income, Education Level, Employment Status, and Marital Status. The results indicate that while Age does not show significant drift, Income, Education Level, Employment Status, and Marital Status exhibit substantial drift, suggesting changes in the underlying population characteristics over time. This report also includes a detailed tools analysis and concludes with recommendations for further action.

## Dataset Synopsis
The dataset consists of 1000 samples with the following features:

- **Age**: Numerical feature representing the age of individuals, ranging from 18 to 65 years.
- **Income**: Numerical feature indicating annual income in thousands of dollars, ranging from $20,000 to $70,000.
- **Education Level**: Categorical feature reflecting the highest education level attained, on a scale from 0 (no formal education) to 3 (graduate degree).
- **Employment Status**: Categorical feature representing current employment status, categorized as 0 (unemployed), 1 (part-time), or 2 (full-time).
- **Marital Status**: Categorical feature indicating current marital status, categorized into Single (0), Married (1), or Divorced (2).
- **ProgramEligibility**: Label variable indicating eligibility for a specific program, with 0 representing not eligible and 1 representing eligible.

### Feature Descriptions
- **Age**: Age of the individual in years.
- **Income**: Annual income of the individual in thousands of dollars.
- **Education Level**: Highest education level attained.
- **Employment Status**: Current employment status.
- **Marital Status**: Current marital status.
- **ProgramEligibility**: Indicates eligibility for a specific program.

## Detailed Tools Analysis
The analysis of the dataset was conducted using Kullback-Leibler divergence to assess drift in the features. The results are summarized below:

### Drift Analysis Results
1. **Age**
   - **Drift Score**: 0.0633
   - **Drift Detected**: No
   - **Current Distribution**: 
     - Peaks at ages 30.8 and 41.0.
   - **Reference Distribution**: 
     - Peaks at ages 27.4 and 36.8.

2. **Income**
   - **Drift Score**: 0.7978
   - **Drift Detected**: Yes
   - **Current Distribution**: 
     - Significant shift towards higher income values.
   - **Reference Distribution**: 
     - Concentrated around lower income values.

3. **Education Level**
   - **Drift Score**: 0.1852
   - **Drift Detected**: Yes
   - **Current Distribution**: 
     - Limited representation of higher education levels.
   - **Reference Distribution**: 
     - More balanced representation across education levels.

4. **Employment Status**
   - **Drift Score**: 0.7047
   - **Drift Detected**: Yes
   - **Current Distribution**: 
     - High representation of part-time employment.
   - **Reference Distribution**: 
     - More balanced between unemployed and full-time.

5. **Marital Status**
   - **Drift Score**: 0.8027
   - **Drift Detected**: Yes
   - **Current Distribution**: 
     - Higher representation of single individuals.
   - **Reference Distribution**: 
     - More balanced representation across marital statuses.

### SHAP Values Analysis
The SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values indicate the contribution of each feature to the model's predictions:

- **Income**: Increased from 0.169 to 0.249, indicating a higher influence on eligibility predictions.
- **Age**: Decreased from 0.168 to 0.101, suggesting a reduced influence.
- **Education Level**: Decreased from 0.110 to 0.068, indicating a lower contribution.
- **Marital Status**: Increased from 0.054 to 0.100, suggesting a higher influence.
- **Employment Status**: Decreased from 0.018 to 0.011, indicating a reduced influence.

## Conclusion
The analysis of the "Eligibility Simulation Data" reveals significant drift in several key features, particularly Income, Education Level, Employment Status, and Marital Status. These changes may reflect shifts in the population characteristics and could impact the model's predictive performance. It is recommended to regularly monitor these features and consider retraining the model to ensure its accuracy and relevance. Additionally, further investigation into the causes of drift may provide insights for improving program eligibility criteria and outreach strategies. 

### Recommendations
- Implement regular monitoring of data drift for key features.
- Consider retraining the model periodically to adapt to changes in the population.
- Investigate the underlying causes of drift to inform program adjustments and outreach efforts.
