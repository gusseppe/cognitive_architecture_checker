            ### Age

            **Feature Report: Age**

**Description:** The 'Age' feature represents the age of the individual in years, ranging from 18 to 65.

**Type:** Numerical

**Possible Values:** Ranging from 18 to 65 years.

**Data Type:** int

**Get Drift Report:**

The get_drift_report tool was used to analyze the distribution of the 'Age' feature between the reference and current datasets. The results indicate that the Kullback-Leibler divergence statistical test was used to detect drift, with a threshold of 0.1. The drift score for the 'Age' feature is 0.06325575780482698, which is below the threshold, indicating that no significant drift was detected.

The distribution information for the current and reference datasets is also provided. The current dataset shows a peak at around 24-27 years, while the reference dataset shows a peak at around 22-27 years. Although there is a slight shift in the distribution, it is not significant enough to be considered drifted.

**Get Shap Values:**

The get_shap_values tool was used to calculate the mean(|SHAP value|) for the 'Age' feature. The result shows that the average impact of the 'Age' feature on the model's predictions is 0.1675692700443467 in the reference dataset and 0.10098040394127042 in the current dataset. The position of the 'Age' feature based on its mean Mean(|SHAP value|) value is 2 in both datasets.

Overall, the analysis suggests that the 'Age' feature has a moderate impact on the model's predictions, and there is no significant drift detected in the distribution of the feature between the reference and current datasets.

            ### Income

            **Income Feature Analysis**

The 'Income' feature is a numerical feature that represents the annual income of an individual in thousands of dollars, ranging from $20,000 to $70,000. This feature is an important indicator of an individual's economic status.

**Get Drift Report**

The get_drift_report tool was used to analyze the distribution of the 'Income' feature between the reference and current datasets. The results indicate that the 'Income' feature shows drift, with a drift score of 0.7978008461594442. This means that the distribution of the 'Income' feature has changed significantly between the reference and current datasets, which may lead to a decrease in model performance.

The Kullback-Leibler divergence statistical test was used to detect drift, and the threshold was set to 0.1. The test results show that the current distribution of the 'Income' feature is significantly different from the reference distribution, with a p-value of less than 0.1.

The current distribution of the 'Income' feature is skewed to the right, with a majority of the values concentrated in the lower range of the distribution (20,000 to 40,000). In contrast, the reference distribution is more evenly distributed across the range of values.

**Get Shap Values**

The get_shap_values tool was used to calculate the mean(|SHAP value|) for the 'Income' feature. The results show that the 'Income' feature has a significant impact on the model's predictions, with a mean(|SHAP value|) of 0.24910130910592299.

The SHAP values indicate that the 'Income' feature is the most important feature in the model, with a rank position of 1. This suggests that the model is highly sensitive to changes in the 'Income' feature, and that this feature plays a critical role in determining the model's predictions.

Overall, the analysis of the 'Income' feature suggests that it is an important indicator of an individual's economic status, and that changes in this feature may have a significant impact on the model's predictions.
