**Comprehensive Report: Eligibility Simulation Data Analysis**
============================================================

**Executive Summary**
---------------

This report provides an in-depth analysis of the Eligibility Simulation Data, focusing on the distributional drift detection and feature importance analysis. The dataset consists of 1000 samples, with five features: Age, Income, Education Level, Employment Status, and Marital Status. The label variable, ProgramEligibility, indicates whether an individual is eligible (1) or not eligible (0) for a specific program.

**Dataset Synopsis**
-----------------

### Features

* **Numerical Features:** Age, Income
* **Categorical Features:** Education Level, Employment Status, Marital Status
* **Label:** ProgramEligibility (0: Not eligible, 1: Eligible)

### Feature Descriptions

* **Age:** Age of the individual in years, ranging from 18 to 65.
* **Income:** Annual income of the individual in thousands of dollars, indicating economic status, ranging from 20k to 70k.
* **Education Level:** Reflects the highest education level attained, on a scale from 0 (no formal education) to 3 (graduate degree), suggesting educational attainment.
* **Employment Status:** Current employment status, represented as 0 (unemployed), 1 (part-time), or 2 (full-time), indicating job market participation.
* **Marital Status:** Current marital status, categorized into Single, Married, or Divorced, to provide demographic insights.
