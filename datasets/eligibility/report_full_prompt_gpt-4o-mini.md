# Comprehensive Report on Eligibility Simulation Data

## Executive Summary
This report provides an in-depth analysis of the "Eligibility Simulation Data" dataset, which simulates the eligibility of individuals for a specific program based on various demographic and economic attributes. The analysis focuses on detecting data drift in key features such as Age, Income, Education Level, Employment Status, and Marital Status. The results indicate that while Age does not exhibit significant drift, Income, Education Level, Employment Status, and Marital Status show substantial drift, suggesting changes in the underlying data distribution. This report also includes a detailed tools analysis and concludes with recommendations for further action.

## Dataset Synopsis
The dataset consists of 1,000 samples with the following features:

- **Age**: Numeric, ranging from 18 to 65 years.
- **Income**: Numeric, representing annual income in thousands of dollars, ranging from $20,000 to $70,000.
- **Education Level**: Categorical, indicating the highest education level attained (0: No formal education, 1: High school diploma, 2: Bachelor degree, 3: Graduate degree).
- **Employment Status**: Categorical, representing current employment status (0: Unemployed, 1: Part-time, 2: Full-time).
- **Marital Status**: Categorical, indicating current marital status (0: Single, 1: Married, 2: Divorced).
- **ProgramEligibility**: Label variable indicating eligibility for a specific program (0: Not eligible, 1: Eligible).

### Dataset Description
The dataset simulates the eligibility of individuals for a specific program, focusing on attributes such as Age, Income, Education Level, Employment Status, and Marital Status. The 'ProgramEligibility' variable serves as the label, indicating whether an individual is eligible (1) or not eligible (0) for the program.

## Detailed Tools Analysis
### Drift Detection Results
The analysis utilized Kullback-Leibler divergence to assess drift in the dataset. The results are summarized below:

- **Age**:
  - Drift Score: 0.0633
  - Drift Detected: No
- **Income**:
  - Drift Score: 0.7978
  - Drift Detected: Yes
- **Education Level**:
  - Drift Score: 0.1852
  - Drift Detected: Yes
- **Employment Status**:
  - Drift Score: 0.7047
  - Drift Detected: Yes
- **Marital Status**:
  - Drift Score: 0.8027
  - Drift Detected: Yes

### SHAP Values Analysis
The SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values provide insights into the contribution of each feature to the model's predictions:

- **Income**: 
  - Current SHAP Value: 0.2491 (Position: 1)
  - Reference SHAP Value: 0.1690 (Position: 1)
- **Age**: 
  - Current SHAP Value: 0.1010 (Position: 2)
  - Reference SHAP Value: 0.1676 (Position: 2)
- **Education Level**: 
  - Current SHAP Value: 0.0685 (Position: 4)
  - Reference SHAP Value: 0.1101 (Position: 3)
- **Marital Status**: 
  - Current SHAP Value: 0.0996 (Position: 3)
  - Reference SHAP Value: 0.0541 (Position: 4)
- **Employment Status**: 
  - Current SHAP Value: 0.0110 (Position: 5)
  - Reference SHAP Value: 0.0183 (Position: 5)

## Conclusion
The analysis of the "Eligibility Simulation Data" reveals significant drift in several key features, particularly Income, Education Level, Employment Status, and Marital Status. This drift indicates that the underlying data distribution has changed, which may impact the model's performance and predictions. 

### Recommendations
1. **Data Monitoring**: Implement continuous monitoring of the dataset to detect further drift and adjust the model accordingly.
2. **Model Retraining**: Consider retraining the model with updated data to ensure its accuracy and relevance.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Explore additional features or transformations that may enhance model performance in light of the detected drift.

By addressing these recommendations, stakeholders can maintain the integrity and effectiveness of the eligibility prediction model.
