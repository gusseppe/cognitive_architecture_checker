**Comprehensive Monitoring Report on Dataset Changes**

**Introduction**

This report provides an analysis of changes in the dataset over time, focusing on the columns 'Age', 'Income', 'Education Level', 'Marital Status', and 'Employment Status'. The report includes results from the GetDriftReport and GetSHAPValues tools, which help identify potential drift and explain the changes in the data.

**Drift Detection**

The GetDriftReport tool was used to detect changes in the distribution of the data over time. The results are presented below:

| Column Name | Column Type | Stat Test Name | Stat Test Threshold | Drift Score | Drift Detected |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Age | num | Kullback-Leibler divergence | 0.1 | 0.06325575780482698 | False |
| Income | num | Kullback-Leibler divergence | 0.1 | 0.7978008461594442 | True |
| Education Level | cat | Kullback-Leibler divergence | 0.1 | 0.1851521399815421 | True |
| Employment Status | cat | Kullback-Leibler divergence | 0.1 | 0.7046963105072126 | True |
| Marital Status | cat | Kullback-Leibler divergence | 0.1 | 0.8026944167960824 | True |

The results indicate that the 'Income' column has detected a significant drift, while the other columns have not. This suggests that the distribution of income has changed over time.

**SHAP Values**

The GetSHAPValues tool was used to explain the changes in the data. The results are presented below:

| Column Name | Reference Value | Current Value | Position |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Income | 0.16902756259348087 | 0.24910130910592299 | 1 |
| Age | 0.1675692700443467 | 0.10098040394127042 | 2 |
| Education Level | 0.11009905271521023 | 0.06845397004237376 | 4 |
| Marital Status | 0.05409217592159332 | 0.09958768447538655 | 3 |
| Employment Status | 0.018275746416542244 | 0.010987271996598626 | 5 |

The results show that the SHAP values for 'Income' have increased, indicating that the current data is more extreme than the reference data. The SHAP values for 'Age' have decreased, indicating that the current data is less extreme than the reference data. The SHAP values for the categorical columns ('Education Level', 'Marital Status', and 'Employment Status') have also changed, but the interpretation is more complex due to the categorical nature of the data.

**Conclusion**

The report highlights significant changes in the 'Income' column, which has detected a drift in the data. The SHAP values for 'Income' indicate that the current data is more extreme than the reference data. The other columns have not detected significant drift, but the SHAP values for 'Age' and the categorical columns have changed. These changes may indicate underlying shifts in the data distribution or other factors that require further investigation.

**Recommendations**

1. Investigate the causes of the drift in the 'Income' column to determine if it is a result of changes in the data generation process or other factors.
2. Monitor the SHAP values for the categorical columns to identify any changes in the data distribution or underlying factors.
3. Consider implementing data quality checks or data preprocessing techniques to address any issues that may be contributing to the changes in the data.

By regularly monitoring the dataset for changes and investigating any significant shifts, data scientists can ensure the quality and integrity of the data and make informed decisions about data analysis and modeling.
