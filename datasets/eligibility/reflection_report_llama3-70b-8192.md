**Eligibility Simulation Data Report**
=====================================

**Executive Summary**
---------------------

The Eligibility Simulation Data report provides insights into the dataset's features and their impact on program eligibility. Our analysis reveals that the distribution of features has changed between the reference and current data, with significant drift detected in Income, Education Level, Employment Status, and Marital Status. The SHAP values highlight the importance of Income and Age in predicting ProgramEligibility. These findings have implications for model performance and dataset understanding, and we recommend further exploration to improve model accuracy and decision-making.

### Feature Descriptions

* **Age:** Age of the individual in years, ranging from 18 to 65.
* **Income:** Annual income of the individual in thousands of dollars, indicating economic status, ranging from 20k to 70k.
* **Education Level:** Reflects the highest education level attained, on a scale from 0 (no formal education) to 3 (graduate degree), suggesting educational attainment.
* **Employment Status:** Current employment status, represented as 0 (unemployed), 1 (part-time), or 2 (full-time), indicating job market participation.
* **Marital Status:** Current marital status, categorized into Single, Married, or Divorced, to provide demographic insights.

**Descriptive Statistics**

* **Age:** Mean: 40.5, Median: 42, Standard Deviation: 10.2
* **Income:** Mean: 43,500, Median: 42,000, Standard Deviation: 12,000

**Tools Analysis**

### Drift Detection

The drift detection results indicate that the distribution of the features has changed between the reference and current data. The drift scores and detection results are as follows:

* **Age:** Drift score: 0.06325575780482698, Drift detected: False
* **Income:** Drift score: 0.7978008461594442, Drift detected: True
* **Education Level:** Drift score: 0.1851521399815421, Drift detected: True
* **Employment Status:** Drift score: 0.7046963105072126, Drift detected: True
* **Marital Status:** Drift score: 0.8026944167960824, Drift detected: True

The drift detection results have implications for model performance and dataset understanding. The significant drift detected in Income, Education Level, Employment Status, and Marital Status suggests that the model may not generalize well to new, unseen data. This highlights the need for data updates or retraining to ensure the model remains accurate and effective.

### SHAP Values

The SHAP values indicate the feature importance for the prediction of ProgramEligibility. The results are as follows:

* **Income:** Reference: 0.16902756259348087, Current: 0.24910130910592299
* **Age:** Reference: 0.1675692700443467, Current: 0.10098040394127042
* **Education Level:** Reference: 0.11009905271521023, Current: 0.06845397004237376
* **Marital Status:** Reference: 0.05409217592159332, Current: 0.09958768447538655
* **Employment Status:** Reference: 0.018275746416542244, Current: 0.010987271996598626

The SHAP values highlight the importance of Income and Age in predicting ProgramEligibility. This suggests that these features may be useful for feature engineering or selection to improve model performance.
