Each record includes Product ID (string), Category (categorical), Month (date format), Quantity Sold (integer), Unit Price (float), and Total Revenue (calculated field). The dataset is relatively clean with minimal missing values or outliers; however, some duplicate records were identified and removed during the data preparation stage.

Tools Analysis:
The analysis was conducted using Python programming language and various libraries such as pandas for data manipulation, matplotlib for visualization, and scikit-learn for statistical modeling. The dataset underwent several preprocessing steps to ensure its quality before conductebased analysis. Missing values were addressed by imputing the median value of each column or removing records with missing information when appropriate. Duplicate records were identified using a combination of Product ID, Category, Month, and Quantity Sold fields and removed from the dataset. Data transformation techniques such as normalization and encoding categorical variables were applied to prepare the data for further analysis.
