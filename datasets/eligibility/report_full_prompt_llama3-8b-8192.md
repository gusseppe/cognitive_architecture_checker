**Executive Summary**
=====================

The dataset provided is a simulation of eligibility for a specific program, focusing on attributes such as Age, Income, Education Level, Employment Status, and Marital Status. The dataset consists of 1000 samples with 6 features and 1 label variable, ProgramEligibility. The analysis reveals that there are significant drifts detected in the Income, Education Level, Employment Status, and Marital Status features, indicating changes in the distribution of these variables over time.

**Dataset Synopsis**
=====================

The dataset is titled "Eligibility Simulation Data" and is described as a simulation of the eligibility of individuals for a specific program. The dataset consists of 1000 samples with 6 features:

* **Age**: Age of the individual in years, ranging from 18 to 65.
* **Income**: Annual income of the individual in thousands of dollars, indicating economic status, ranging from 20k to 70k.
* **Education Level**: Reflects the highest education level attained, on a scale from 0 (no formal education) to 3 (graduate degree), suggesting educational attainment.
* **Employment Status**: Current employment status, represented as 0 (unemployed), 1 (part-time), or 2 (full-time), indicating job market participation.
* **Marital Status**: Current marital status, categorized into Single, Married, or Divorced, to provide demographic insights.
* **ProgramEligibility**: Indicates eligibility for a specific program, with 0 representing not eligible and 1 representing eligible, serving as the label variable for predictions.

**Tools Analysis**
=====================

The analysis reveals that the following features have significant drifts detected:

* **Income**: The drift score is 0.7978008461594442, indicating a significant change in the distribution of Income over time.
* **Education Level**: The drift score is 0.1851521399815421, indicating a moderate change in the distribution of Education Level over time.
* **Employment Status**: The drift score is 0.7046963105072126, indicating a moderate change in the distribution of Employment Status over time.
* **Marital Status**: The drift score is 0.8026944167960824, indicating a significant change in the distribution of Marital Status over time.

The Shap values analysis reveals that the features with the highest absolute values are:

* **Income**: The Shap value is 0.24910130910592299, indicating that Income has the highest impact on the ProgramEligibility label.
* **Age**: The Shap value is 0.1675692700443467, indicating that Age has a moderate impact on the ProgramEligibility label.

**Conclusion**
============

The analysis reveals significant drifts detected in the Income, Education Level, Employment Status, and Marital Status features, indicating changes in the distribution of these variables over time. The Shap values analysis highlights the importance of Income and Age in predicting the ProgramEligibility label. These findings suggest that the program eligibility model should be updated to account for these changes in the data distribution.
