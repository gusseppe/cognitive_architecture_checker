The monitoring report indicates significant dataset drift in features such as "Income," "Education Level," "Employment Status," and "Marital Status." The SHAP analysis shows that "Income" has become more important, while "Age" and "Education Level" have decreased in importance. This suggests that the model may need to be updated to account for these changes in feature distributions and their impacts on predictions.
