# Comprehensive Monitoring Report on Dataset Changes

## Overview
This report provides an analysis of changes in the dataset based on drift detection and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values. The analysis focuses on five key features: Age, Income, Education Level, Employment Status, and Marital Status. 

## Drift Detection Results
Drift detection was performed using the Kullback-Leibler divergence method. The results indicate whether significant changes have occurred in the distributions of the features compared to a reference dataset.

### Summary of Drift Detection

| Income             | 0.7978      | Yes            | 0.1                 | Significant changes detected | Significant changes detected |
| Education Level    | 0.1852      | Yes            | 0.1                 | Significant changes detected | Significant changes detected |
| Employment Status   | 0.7047      | Yes            | 0.1                 | Significant changes detected | Significant changes detected |
| Marital Status     | 0.8027      | Yes            | 0.1                 | Significant changes detected | Significant changes detected |

### Detailed Drift Analysis
1. **Age**: 
   - **Drift Score**: 0.0633 (No drift detected)
   - The distribution of ages has not significantly changed compared to the reference dataset.

2. **Income**: 
   - **Drift Score**: 0.7978 (Drift detected)
   - The income distribution has changed significantly, indicating a potential shift in the population's economic status.

3. **Education Level**: 
   - **Drift Score**: 0.1852 (Drift detected)
   - There is a notable change in the education level distribution, suggesting a shift in the educational background of the population.

4. **Employment Status**: 
   - **Drift Score**: 0.7047 (Drift detected)
   - The employment status distribution has changed significantly, which may reflect changes in the job market or employment trends.

5. **Marital Status**: 
   - **Drift Score**: 0.8027 (Drift detected)
   - Significant changes in marital status distribution indicate potential shifts in social dynamics.

## SHAP Values Analysis
SHAP values provide insights into the importance of each feature in the model's predictions. The following table summarizes the SHAP values for both the current and reference datasets.

### Summary of SHAP Values
| Feature            | Reference SHAP Value | Current SHAP Value | Change in Importance |
|--------------------|----------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Income             | 0.1690               | 0.2491              | Increased            |
| Age                | 0.1676               | 0.1009              | Decreased            |
| Education Level    | 0.1101               | 0.0685              | Decreased            |
| Marital Status     | 0.0541               | 0.0996              | Increased            |
| Employment Status   | 0.0183               | 0.0110              | Decreased            |

### Detailed SHAP Analysis
1. **Income**: 
   - **Change**: Increased from 0.1690 to 0.2491
   - Income has become a more significant predictor in the current dataset, reflecting its growing importance.

2. **Age**: 
   - **Change**: Decreased from 0.1676 to 0.1009
   - The importance of age as a predictor has diminished in the current dataset.

3. **Education Level**: 
   - **Change**: Decreased from 0.1101 to 0.0685
   - Education level has also become less significant in the current dataset.

4. **Marital Status**: 
   - **Change**: Increased from 0.0541 to 0.0996
   - Marital status has gained importance as a predictor in the current dataset.

5. **Employment Status**: 
   - **Change**: Decreased from 0.0183 to 0.0110
   - Employment status has seen a decline in its predictive power.

## Conclusion
The analysis indicates significant changes in the distributions of Income, Education Level, Employment Status, and Marital Status, while Age remains stable. The SHAP values reveal that Income and Marital Status have increased in importance, whereas Age, Education Level, and Employment Status have decreased. These findings suggest a need for further investigation into the underlying causes of these changes, particularly in the context of economic and social factors affecting the population. 

### Recommendations
- **Further Investigation**: Conduct a deeper analysis to understand the reasons behind the significant changes in Income, Education Level, Employment Status, and Marital Status.
- **Model Update**: Consider updating the predictive model to account for the changes in feature importance and distribution shifts.
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Implement ongoing monitoring of these features to detect future changes promptly.
