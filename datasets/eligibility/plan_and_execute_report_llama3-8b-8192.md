**Comprehensive Monitoring Report on Dataset Changes**

**Introduction**

This report provides an overview of the changes detected in the dataset over time. The analysis is based on the results of the `GetDriftReport` and `GetSHAPValues` tools.

**Drift Detection**

The `GetDriftReport` tool was used to detect changes in the distribution of the dataset. The results are presented below:

| Column Name | Drift Score | Drift Detected |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Income | 0.7978008461594442 | True |
| Education Level | 0.1851521399815421 | True |
| Employment Status | 0.7046963105072126 | True |
| Marital Status | 0.8026944167960824 | True |
| Age | 0.06325575780482698 | False |

The drift scores indicate the magnitude of the changes detected in each column. A higher score indicates a greater degree of change. The `drift_detected` column indicates whether a significant change was detected in each column.

**SHAP Values**

The `GetSHAPValues` tool was used to calculate the SHAP values for each column. The results are presented below:

| Column Name | Reference Value | Current Value | Position |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Income | 0.16902756259348087 | 0.24910130910592299 | 1 |
| Age | 0.1675692700443467 | 0.10098040394127042 | 2 |
| Education Level | 0.11009905271521023 | 0.06845397004237376 | 4 |
| Marital Status | 0.05409217592159332 | 0.09958768447538655 | 3 |
| Employment Status | 0.018275746416542244 | 0.010987271996598626 | 5 |

The SHAP values represent the contribution of each feature to the predicted outcome. The `reference` and `current` values represent the SHAP values for the reference and current datasets, respectively. The `position` column indicates the relative importance of each feature.

**Conclusion**

This report highlights the changes detected in the dataset over time. The drift detection results indicate significant changes in the distribution of the `Income`, `Education Level`, `Employment Status`, and `Marital Status` columns. The SHAP values provide insights into the relative importance of each feature in the prediction model. These findings can inform data quality control measures and model updates to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the predictive model.
