Thought: The SHAP values provide insights into the feature importance in both datasets. I notice that 'Income' has the highest SHAP value in both the reference and current datasets, indicating its significant impact on the model's predictions. The 'Age' column also has a relatively high SHAP value in the reference dataset, but its value is lower in the current dataset, suggesting a decrease in its importance. The 'Education Level' and 'Marital Status' columns have lower SHAP values in both datasets, while the 'Employment Status' column has the lowest SHAP value in both datasets.

Action: None
