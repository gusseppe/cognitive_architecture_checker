 The provided data indicates that there are significant drifts in the distributions of several columns when comparing the current dataset to a reference dataset. Specifically, the following columns have been flagged for having a drift score above the threshold and thus indicating potential concept drift:

1. Income (drift_score = 0.798)
2. Education Level (drift_score = 0.185)
3. Employment Status (drift_score = 0.705)
4. Marital Status (drift_score = 0.803)

These drifts suggest that the underlying data distribution for these features has changed, which could impact any predictive models or analyses based on this dataset. It is recommended to investigate further and consider updating your model if necessary.
