 # Eligibility Simulation Data Analysis Report

## Dataset Overview
The dataset provided simulates the eligibility of individuals for a specific program based on various attributes such as Age, Income, Education Level, Employment Status, and Marital Status. The label variable 'ProgramEligibility' indicates whether an individual is eligible (1) or not eligible (n(0)) for the program.

## Data Description
The dataset contains information on individuals with attributes ranging from 18 to 65 years of age, annual income between $20k and $70k, education levels from no formal education to graduate degree, employment statuses (unemployed, part-time, full-time), and marital statuses (single, married, divorced).

## Feature Descriptions
1. **Age**: Age of the individual in years, ranging from 18 to 65.
2. **Income**: Annual income of the individual in thousands of dollars, indicating economic status, ranging from 20k to 70k.
3. **Education Level**: Reflects the highest education level attained, on a scale from 0 (no formal education) to 3 (graduate degree), suggesting educational attainment.
4. **Employment Status**: Current employment status, represented as 0 (unemployed), 1 (part-time), or 2 (full-time), indicating job market participation.
5. **Marital Status**: Current marital status, categorized into Single, Married, or Divorced, to provide demographic insights.
6. **ProgramEligibility**: Indicates eligibility for a specific program, with 0 representing not eligible and 1 representing eligible, serving as the label variable for predictions.

## Data Analysis Results
The data analysis results show that there is a drift in the distribution of features between the reference dataset (historical) and current datasets. The divergence score indicates significant changes in feature distributions over time:
- Age: 0.8026944167960824
- Income: 0.5358974358974359
- Education Level: 0.8026944167960824
- Employment Status: 0.8026944167960824
- Marital Status: 0.8026944167960824

The drift detection algorithm has identified a significant change in the distribution of features, with all feature distributions showing divergence scores above the threshold value (stattest_threshold = 0.1). This indicates that there is a need to update or retrain models based on this dataset for accurate predictions and analysis.

## Conclusion
The Eligibility Simulation Data Analysis Report highlights significant changes in feature distributions over time, indicating the necessity of updating or retraining predictive models using current datasets. The drift detection algorithm has successfully identified these changes, allowing data scientists to take appropriate actions for maintaining model accuracy and relevance.
